 +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Upon receipt of your registration fee with the completed registration
   form you will receive a registration key which will correspond to the
   registration string given in the registration form.

   Upon receipt of your registration key you should start FAR  from  the
   command line with -r switch:

   FAR -r

   then  enter  your  name  (registration  string)  and  the  key   when
   requested. This will activate the registered features of FAR.

   It is possible, depending upon the facilities available at your local
   registration site, to have the key delivered to your computer system,
   to have it made available for pickup by you or to have  it  delivered
   by your local postal service.
