---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAR 1.70 (build 2087) (29.03.2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MultiArc
~~~~~~~~
[+] Added the possibility to control the priority of the archiver process.
[*] When viewing ARJ archives, the file creation time and last access time
    are shown, if the archive was created by a version of ARJ that supports
    storing this information.
[+] The number of chapters in the archive is now shown in the
    information panel.
[+] Added the character 'C' to the syntax of custom.ini. When analyzing
    the archiver listing, it will be parsed as the number of chapters.
[!] The default settings of CAB.FMT are now designed to work with
    MsCab.exe version 0.63 or later. The latest versions of the
    archiver can be downloaded here:
    http://plugring.farmanager.com/cgi-bin/downld.cgi?Draw=List&Select=PlugIn&SelectPlugIn=310
[-] MultiArc sub plugins were incorrectly initialized when adding files
    to archive if the "Read archive descriptions" option was on.
[-] When scanning archive contents, folder attributes were set
    incorrectly (read-only, hidden).
[-] While opening a corrupted archive, containing no files, the same
    error message were given twice.
[+] VersionInfo resource was added to all FMT-modules.
[+] ARC.FMT was added.
[!] Identification mechanism of ZIP, LHA and RAR archives was toughened.
    Some files (e.g. KasperskyLab modules - minizip.ppl, rar.ppl, zip.ppl)
    contain signatures for archive identification, those signatures were
    causing those files to be wrongly identified as archives.
[-] RAR archive ending was not detected correctly. Some archives were
    considered erroneous by RAR.FMT and the "Unexpected end of archive"
    message was displayed.
[-] Certain fields (such as file attribute field) were processed
    incorrectly for LHA archive format.
[-] Tarballs created on certain AIX systems were not properly recognized
    by TAR.FMT
[-] Incorrect interpretation of the TAR archives' directory.
[!] Fixed the incompatibility with the "Data Execution Prevention" technology
    that is present in some modern CPUs and supported since Windows XP SP2 and
    Windows Server 2003 SP1.
[!] It is now possible to use regular expressions (Perl5 syntax) in
    custom.ini. Regular expressions can be used in the following
    parameters: 'FormatX', 'IgnoreStringX', 'Start', 'End'. The new
    syntax is described inside the custom.ini file.
[+] 'ma' prefix to directly open an archive with the plugin.
[+] To get a listing from RAR archives with an encrypted header the UnRAR.dll
    is used (if the library is found in the path). Because of limitations of
    the UnRAR library the last access and modification dates will be empty.
[+] New flag - AF_HDRENCRYPTED.
[+] TechInfo#71.

Network
~~~~~~~
[-] Doubling of hidden resources when changing to none existing path
    using the 'CD' command in plugin's panel.
[-] Incorrect handling of quotes in prefix. The command
      net:"server"
    was interpreted literally, resulting in search for a computer name
    "server".
[-] Erroneous behaviour while trying to open a remote share using a
    wrong account or when user interrupts the login procedure.
[-] Recurrent scanning of network after an erroneous logon request.
[+] Added functionality to open remote resources with explicitly
    specified credentials. See online help.
[-] Erroneous behavior occurred while changing the current directory one
    level up from a shared resource with a name containing non-English
    characters.
[-] No error messages were displayed and an empty panel was shown
    when trying to connect from the command line to a remote computer access
    to which is not permited for the current user.
    From now on upon connecting
    to such a computer the plugin asks for username and password
    and, if the user cancels the operation, returns to the providers list.
[+] The algorithm for connecting to remote resources with explicitly
    specified credentials was changed. Now, if the error "Wrong username
    or password" is returned by the system the plugin will try to
    bring the username to the form "Computer\User", where
    Computer is the name of the remote computer and User is the
    username. A second connection attempt will be made, and if the error
    happens again, the user will be notified of the error.
[-] Sometimes in Windows 95/98/ME, due to the internal system error, the
    plugin was displaying a message "Cannot browse network" in response to
    any action.
[-] Accessing a network share mapped to the root of an empty drive
    resulted in the "File not found" error.
[+] Added a virtual "Favorites" folder to the providers list.
[+] Added a "Remember password" option to the login dialog. If this option is
    selected then in the case of a successful connection to the remote
    resource the account info used for the login will be saved in the registry
    and the remote resource will be automatically added to the "Favorites"
    folder.
[!] A remark on security. Account info that is used to connect to remote
    resources from the "Favorites" folder is saved in the registry
    UNENCRYPTED.
[+] The algorithm for connecting to remote resources has been changed:
    1. The plugin attempts to connect to the remote resource without
    specifying username and password. If the attempt fails go to 2.
    2. The plugin attempts to locate the specified remote resource in the
    "Favorites" folder. If such is found the plugin will then try to connect
    using the found credentials else go to 3.
    3. The user is asked to enter the username and password and the plugin
    attempts to connect using the specified credentials.
[+] Added "Show share full name" option to plugin's configuration dialog,
    by default the option is on. If this option is on the plugin shows share
    names as before (i.e. "\\Server", "\\Server\Share"). If this option if off
    then the names are shown in a short form (i.e. "Server", "Share").
[+] Added "Browse up to favorites if possible" option to plugin's
    configuration dialog, by default the option is on. If the option is on
    then when changing to ".." "Favorites" will open if the remote resource is
    located there. If this option if off then no attempt to locate the remote
    resource in "Favorites" is done.
[+] Added "Check resource reachability" option to plugin's configuration
    dialog, by default the option is on. If the option is on then only remote
    resources that are currently reachable in the network will be shown in
    the "Favorites" folder.
[+] Added "Show ".." in the providers" option to plugin's configuration
    dialog, by default the option is on.
[*] When called from the command line, the plug-in transforms a specified
    computer's name into upper case.
[+] Now you can create folders inside the Favorites.

TmpPanel
~~~~~~~~
[-] Copying/moving by the Shift-F5/Shift-F6 key combination was
    not working properly.
[+] Alt+Shift+F3 on an element:
    * if folder - shows its contents in the passive panel.
    * if file - positions the cursor on this file in the passive panel.
[+] Shift+Enter on a folder - opens its contents in explorer.
[+] List file is also searched in the plugin folder.
[+] New file "shortcuts.temp" for fast changing into the "standard"
    Windows folders and "shortcats.reg" - binds it to Ctrl+Apps.
[+] F3 on a folder shows its size ([ ] Safe panel mode)
[-] When the "New panel for search results" option was turned on,
    conducting several searches of some files and placing the results
    in the temporary panel (each time to the next one by number) - the
    index of the last active panel was not saved because it is done when
    manually switching by the Alt+Shift+number combination, and as a
    result, after exiting and reentering the temporary panel it was
    opened not with the expected (the last) index.

ProcList
~~~~~~~~
[-] Crash fixed: closing plugin after Alt-F7 search.
[-] Owner info was not refreshed in the panel.
[-] Screen is refreshed faster after user actions.
[-] Processes launched from NTFS file streams (like name1.exe:name2.exe)
    could not be viewed by F3.

    closer to top.
[-] Displaying owner info and other WMI stuff sometimes failed.

FARCmds
~~~~~~~
[-] The macro:post command did not work correctly with some characters
    from the second half of the character table (from 0x80 to 0xFF).
[-] The FARCmds plugin did not specify correct data for the "$Date"
    macro command.
[-] It was impossible to work with files/commands which names begun
    with 1 or 2 (conflict with the Stream argument is eliminated)
[+] For Windows NT and higher the ability to view the contents of a physical
    drive added: "view:\\.\PhysicalDrive0". Note: the plugin also allows to
    view the contents of a logical drive: "view:\\.\c:".
[-] Execution of the "Same Folder" plugins menu item inside a none file
    panel caused the plugin to crash.
[-] Incorrect processing of the 'whereis:' command containing non-english
    letters.
[-] Incorrect processing of 'far:edit[line,column]'.

DrawLine
~~~~~~~~
[+] Now keyboard operations with the plugin (line drawing) can be
    parts of a macro sequence.
[-] Incorrect display of the line type in the status bar when
    the Russian language is selected.
[-] The editor title did not change if the plugin was called when CapsLock,
    NumLock or ScrollLock were off.

FileCase
~~~~~~~~
[-] Problems with hotkeys.
[+] Added word delimiters configuration for the "File Name.Ext" and
    "File Name.ext" conversions. Those characters are used to find word
    boundaries, meaning that an alpha-numeric character following one of
    the delimiters will be considered as the beginning of a word and will
    be converted to upper case.
[*] Plugin interface rewritten.

HlfViewer
~~~~~~~~~
[-] Current user name (FAR /u) was not taken into account while
    reading the configuration parameters.

Advanced Compare
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[*] Now the FAR file panel hiding mode controls the file comparison process in
    the Advanced Compare plugin: if the hidden files aren't displayed, all
    files and folders with the Hidden attribute being compared are skipped.

FAR 1.70 beta 5 (build 1634) (08.04.2003)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MultiArc
~~~~~~~~
[!] By default, ZIP.FMT is configured for 32-bit pkzip 4 and higher.
[!] By default, RAR.FMT is configured for RAR 2.5 or later.
[!] By default, ARJ.FMT is configured for 32-bit arj32 3.08 and higher.
[!] RAR.FMT: removed the -av- parameter (by default, the authentication
    is verified when unpacking)
[+] MultiArc always tries to set the cursor on the newly created archive.
[+] CUSTOM.FMT: INI file sections with names starting with ";" are
    ignored (for example, [;JAR])
[+] Additional features for custom.ini:
    1. Removed the limit on the number of format strings "Format..."
    2. Added parameters "IgnoreString0 ... IgnoreStringN" (optional),
       meaning that the line should be ignored without moving to the
       next format line.
    3. Added characters to specify the file creation and last
       modification time in format strings.
    4. It is now possible to enclose numeric format string parameters
       in parentheses. That means that some or all of the characters
       enclosed in parentheses may not be present in the archiver
       output.
[+] New option "Change folder when setting cursor to the archive".
    If the option is set and the archive is created not in the current
    folder, FAR changes to the folder containing the archive. If the
    option is not set, FAR sets the cursor on the archive only if it
    is created in the current folder.
[*] Restored the FAR 1.70 beta 3 behavior for the "Switches" line in
    the "Add to archive" dialog.
[*] The selection in a file panel is not removed after Alt-F6 is processed.
[*] TARGZ.FMT: changed default settings, instead of the 'Q' modifier
    (quote filenames containing spaces) the 'q' modifier (quote all
    filenames) is used.
[*] LZH.FMT: Improved archive format detection code. The plugin
    recognized some text files as LZH archives.
[*] ARJ.FMT: Improved archive format detection code.

    (LNKTYPE) correctly.
[-] The starting dot was not shown in the panels for files with names
    starting with a dot (like ".cvsignore").
[-] Win9x: when unpacking a file with Cyrillic characters in its
    filename, an empty folder was created with the name consisting of
    incorrectly recorded characters.
[-] CUSTOM.FMT: the mask "*.*" for the RK archiver did not match
    filenames with no extensions.
[!] Changed the rule for storing plugin settings:
    1. Common settings for all users are stored under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
       These settings can be changed only by editing the registry manually
       or by importing .reg files.
    2. All changes to the configuration of specific archivers are stored
       under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
    3. Settings in HKCU have priority over those in HKLM, and settings in
       HKLM have priority over the defaults specified in the FMT module.
[+] Additional features in custom.ini:
    1. Removed the limit on the number of format strings "Format...";
    2. Added parameters "IgnoreString0 ... IgnoreStringN" (optional),
       meaning that the line should be ignored without moving to the
       next format line;
    3. Added characters to specify the file creation and last
       modification time in format strings;
    4. It is now possible to enclose numeric format string parameters
       in parentheses. That means that some or all of the characters
       enclosed in parentheses may not be present in the archiver
       output.

Brackets
~~~~~~~~
[*] Now if cursor stands "after the bracket" it jumps on the bracket not on
    a position next to it. For instance, in this sample ([  ])A cursor from

    opening round bracket.

ProcList
~~~~~~~~
[+] Percent/per second sort modes added (Ctrl-F12), including %CPU.
[+] Processes on Win2000+ hosts can be killed remotely via WMI.
[+] Priorities on WinXP+ hosts can be changed remotely via WMI.

[+] plist://hostname or plist:\\hostname connects to the given host.
[+] Username and password fields added to Connect dialog box
[+] Shift-F3 acts as F3, but with overridden view options
[+] Process current directory is displayed on F3 (local NT only).
[*] Process time information on F3 was duplicated, now removed.
[*] Alt-Shift-F9 is no more processed, since it's handled by FAR.
[-] Fixed some bugs in determining the handle information.
[-] Performance counters were not detected correctly on some machines.

TmpPanel
~~~~~~~~
[+] FAR panel settings controlling the case of displayed file names
    are now taken into account.
[-] In the safe panel mode, the cursor was not positioned correctly
    when Ctrl-PgUp was pressed.

HlfViewer
~~~~~~~~~
[-] When the plugin was invoked through the hlf: prefix, files with
    extension different from .hlf could not be opened.

FARCmds
~~~~~~~
[+] New command Run. Allows to execute an operating system command and
    capture its output to a specified file. The result can be also
    shown on the screen or hidden from the user, depending on the
    output capture modifiers.
[+] Changes in the syntax of the output capture modifiers for external
    commands, such as separate capture for the standard error stream
    and the standard output stream, and so on. The details are given
    in the plugin help.
[+] Defaults for output capture modifiers can be specified in the
    plugin configuration dialog.
[-] The console output mechanism could hang if the external program
    terminated at exactly the time when its output was redirected to
    the console.
[-] Fixed hangs that sometimes occurred when capturing the output of
    built-in commands of Windows 9x (for example, view:<<dir
    when the flag [x] Keep external command output is set).


FARFtp
~~~~~~
[+] Plugin allow next futures with links:
      - sets "Symbolic link" attribute to file on panel;

    looking like:
      Software\Far\Plugins\FTP\Hosts\\Item0\
[!] plugin forget last used column mode.
[!] several errors on copy and move operations on hosts panel.
[!] plugin correctly perform ABOR operation (some severs close command
    connection with old plugin because of wrong ABOR sequence).
[!] strips trailing spaces during process command line.
[+] date and time of plugin compilation added to name of plugin in text
    draw to configuration, plugins and disks menu.
[+] plugin can draw current actions and idle messages into console caption.
[-] inserts default login and password into URL on url creation
    procedure. (Used on copy URL to clipboard and drop pathname to command

[*] "Ask overwrite" message created as dialog with two buttons rows.
[+] added future to manipulate with multiply connections. See help for
    utilities menu (Shift+F1) for details.
[+] draws number of received bytes on receive directory listing.
[+] plugin does not use FAR procedures to scan directories and draw total size
    of scanned files.
[+] If you set "Show upload dialog" ON you can use new futures:
     - show list of scanned files before downloading;
     - set default overwrite action;
     - set pattern for files to include and to exclude from list to download;
[*] if "CD .." (any way) do not change directory on FTP - plugin closes
    connection and switches to hosts mode.
    If other words: you can close connection by Ctrl+PgUp or selecting ".."
    in ftp root folder.
[+] Set of new techinfos.
      PwdSecurity           - to disable show passwords;
      WaitCounter, WaitIdle - to tune CPU usage;
      RetryTimeout          - to set pause for auto-retry;
      ...
    See "TechInfo.reg" file for details.
[+] plugin quotes url contains quotable characters before place it to
    clipboard or command line.
[+] you can use 'M' and 'K' chars to specify size multiplier in
    IO buffer size.
[+] on return from connection plugin set cursor to host from where you return.
[+] added a warning message if plugin find old format hosts records.
    You must convert
[+] debug plugin version uses ExcDump library to trace errors.
    Please go to:
      http://194.226.246.49/Users/JouriM/html/ExcDump.html
    and get last library if you wish to use debug version and want to
    send full bug-reports to me.
[+] If you set user name but not set password plugin will ask login information
    before connect.
[*] default size of IO buffer set to bigger (800K) value.
[+] Plugin defines two column modes:
      C0 - file rights;
      C1 - name of link (if available);
    Column modes can be customized through LNG files (starting at
    third string) and set by default to:
      9 - "N,S,C0" (Name, Size, Rights) with sizes "0,0,10";
      0 - "N,C1" (Name, Link ) with sizes ("0,0");
[+] Added sub-plugins support.
    Currently used sub-plugins are not the same sort FAR use.
    FTP sub-plugins designed to customize FTP actions by replacing it.
    Plugin currently use two plugins:
      1. DirList - for parse directory listings received from server;
      2. Progress - to draw copy progress dialog;
    All sources for sub-plugins accessible from developer site.
[+] You may set type of server for each host entry to command plugin use
    specified directory listing parser.
    Type of server set to "auto-detect" by default, but not all types can
    be detected correctly and you can manually select correctly type of server.
    See "dirlist.txt" file for description how to interpret and report parser
    errors.
[+] Ctrl+Z on hosts panel open host editor and set cursor to description field.
[!] wrong sorting on hosts panels by description.
    Now sorts:
      NAME  - by host name
      EXT   - by host path
      DESC  - by decryption
      OWNER - by user name
[*] techinfo set amount decreased. All removed options moved to configuration
    dialogs.
[+] copy dialog:
      - totally changed (See plugin help for details).
      - may be fully customized (See reg files in LIB directory).
[+] hosts panel:
     - Ctrl+F inserts url into command line.
       Plugin inserts it just as it entered to url field.
     - Ctrl+Enter inserts into command line name of host.
[!] host name not fully visible in hosts mode.
    Now name of host has a maximum priority and will be always fully
    visible.
[!] do not understand urls with user name contains '@' symbol
[+] hosts "ftp" files contains version of creation
[!] screen shake while FAR Find File operation on FTP panel
[!] hosts copy problems:
      - do not copy between two hosts panel;
      - delete exported host after overwrite confirm;
[!] do not show error message if directory creation fail
[+] plugin configuration dialog totally changed
[+] host edit dialog extended with new options.
    Note: do not bother me any more with problems of uploading speed.
          Plugin works fine, tune it by yourself !
[!] plugin uses '\' instead '/' in file paths then delete files after move
    operation so deletion fails
[+] if login fail plugin can re ask name and password from user.
    See techinfo N7 for disable this feature.
[*] plugin now process F5, F6, Shift+F5, Shift+F6 keys by itself.
    + no more annoying additional dialogs.
    + you enter real FTP paths.
    + you can move files from one plugin panel to another in case
      the both panels on the same FTP site.
      !! Warning: not all FTP server software correctly execute
                  move operation. See "Known.txt" for details.
    + rename of file work correctly.
[!] wrong filenames encoding then autodetect table selected in host options
[!] plugin displays wrong message then files IO errors occurred on local disk
    during up|download operations (f.e. disk full).
[*] plugin processes CD command itself.
    As a result you can correctly change FTP directory using CD command-line
    command to directories looking like MS-DOS paths (f.e. "C:").
[+] "utilities menu" with set of options available when plugin is in connected
    state. See plugin help for details.
[+] plugin remembers last used hosts path and start there next time hosts
    panel shown.
[!] some "specific" old-style hosts files not understood by plugin
    and will be invisible on hosts panel.
[!] plugin exports hosts entries with plain password. Now export crypted.
    !! Warning:
      If you import "*.ftp" files created with old version of plugin you lost
      passwords.
      To solve this potential problem:
         - do not delete old entries before update to new version.
         - Leave it as is.
         - Plugin correctly reads it from registry.
[!] Copy\Move problems:
      - copy files instead rename if plugin opened on both panels
      - file rename fails silently
      - Now plugin correctly move between FTP panels or to path you enter in
        move destination dialog.
    See Known.txt for specifics.
[*] annoying "====" line drawn at top left corner of screen removed
[!] shows assertion message then plugin activated on both panels

    windows clients with the same options.
[!] forgets selected plugin panel mode chosen for hosts panel
[!] plugin traps instead correct display assertion message

EMenu
~~~~~
[+] Prefix command lines can contain %EnvVariables%.
[-] Fixed some problems with paths containing national letters.
[-] Fixed FAR window blinking when GUI menu is used.
[-] NT sendto menu is now showed.
[-] Windows 2000 Copy/Paste bug fixed.
[+] Text menu can be shown at the mouse cursor like GUI menu.
[+] Depending on Shift and Alt corresponding delete method is used.
[+] Plugin configuration is called by Alt-Shift-F9 from any menu.
[-] Russian .hlf mistakes fixed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAR 1.70 beta 4 (build 1282) (13.03.2002)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EMenu
~~~~~
[!] Completely rewritten.


Network
~~~~~~~
[-] Network Browser could not enter a network share if it was mapped to
    the root directory of a drive and that directory was empty.
[-] Jumping from a network drive to the network and the option "Show
    local network" did not work for some Microsoft networks for which
    it could possibly work.
[*] Now it is possible to disable setting the Hidden attribute for ]
    hidden shares (see TechInfo#35).
[*] Added a history list to the edit line for entering the user name
    in the password input dialog.
[+] Now displaying hidden shares works also under Windows 95/98/Me.
[*] Displaying hidden shares under Windows NT/2000/XP no longer requires
    administrator privileges.
[*] When trying to disconnect a network drive mapped to multiple drive
    letters, a dialog is shown allowing to choose which letter is to
    be disconnected.
[-] Fixed problems with handling Cyrillic computer names.


MultiArc
~~~~~~~~
[-] LZH.FMT did not recognize archives created by later versions of
    the LHA archivers.
[-] CAB.FMT didn't work correctly with some SFX archives, for example,
    ar500enu.exe - installation of Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0.
[!] The default settings of CAB.FMT are now designed to work with
    MsCab.exe version 0.60b3 or later. The latest versions of the
    archiver can be downloaded here: http://mateuszb.republika.pl/
[-] "Empty" volumes in multi-volume CAB files (when the beginning of
    the file is in the previous volume and the end is in the next one)
    are now handled correctly when extracting by Shift-F2.
[-] CUSTOM.FMT: corrected the behaviour of the "*" modifier in the
    archiver listing description. Previously one character was always
    handled, even if it was a space or a line break.
[*] CUSTOM.FMT now intercepts archiver error messages that are
    written to the standard error stream.
[!] ACE.FMT correctly shows the dictionary size and is supplied with
    the source code (see PlugDoc.rar::Examples\MultiArc\Formats\ace.cpp).
[!] TAR.FMT correctly handles archives with filenames starting with "./".
[+] For TAR archives, added support for a GNU extension allowing to
    store filenames longer than 100 characters. Previously such names
    were shown as files ".\.\@LongLink" visible in each archive
    directory.
[!] Every archiver has a separate history list for the "Switches" edit
    box (Add files dialog).
[+] New option "Use last command from history" - when adding files to
    archives, the most recently used value of the archiver command line
    parameters will be placed in the "Switches" edit field.
[+] New function GetSFXPos() for second-level plugins. Returns the start
    offset of the archive. MultiArc chooses the SFX module that has
    returned the lowest value (closer to the beginning of a file). This
    fixes a situation when, for example, an uncompressed ARJ archive is
    stored in a ZIP file called "N3gk8v1t.106". Previous versions of
    MultiArc showed the ARJ archive, and not the ZIP archive, when
    entering such a file.
[+] New option in specific archiver settings - "Archive extension",
    allowing to handle the case when the archiver and the FMT module
    have different opinions regarding the default archive extension.
[+] New utility ma_emu.cpp facilitating the debugging of second-level
    plugin modules (see PlugDoc.rar::Examples\MultiArc\Formats\ma_emu.cpp)
[!] Pressing Shift-F1 in the "Add files" dialog shows the "Select
    archiver" menu.
[*] Added a new useful parameter "{-ap%%R}" to RAR command lines. This
    allows to pack files not only to the archive root and to extract
    files without creating the full directory tree up to the folder
    from which files are extracted.
[*] Significantly reworked the algorithm for generating archive names
    and fixed a whole bunch of bugs.
[-] Names with dots are handled correctly.
[-] When adding files to an archive that has a non-default extension,
    MultiArc no longer corrupts the archive file name. Such archives
    can be created using the "Exact archive filename" checkbox.
[!] IMPORTANT: For those who use pkzip archivers, it is strongly
    recommended to add the parameter "-nozipextension" to all command
    lines. This also applies to other archivers that automatically add
    a default extension to the name of a newly created archiver - the
    archiver, if possible, should not interfere into the generation of
    archive names.
[*] The default archive name in the "Add to archive" dialog is no
    longer converted to lower case if it contains mixed case
    characters.
[-] Commands from the "Archive commands" menu (Shift-F3) are no longer
    executed in the background.
[*] An archive command line that is present in the registry but empty
    is no longer replaced with the default line from the FMT module.
    This is needed because the archiver used by the user (for example,
    InfoZip) may not support all commands (conversion to SFX) of the
    default archiver (pkzip/pkunzip).
[*] The line "Archive operation" no longer flashes when searching in
    archives.


ProcList
~~~~~~~~
[!] The internal process list is updated asynchronously in the special
    background thread, so the plugin works well with remote computers on
    slow network connections (e.g. over phone lines).
[+] All panel modes are overridden to display miscellaneous process
    details. These modes are configurable (only via the registry in
    this version; see Help).
[+] Module and handle list is included into the process information exported
    on F3. You can enable module versions and descriptions there;
    by default they are not displayed.
[+] More performance data counters (actually, all of them) are displayed
    under NT.
[+] New items in config dialog; Alt-Shift-F9 calls this dialog from the
    plugin panel.
[+] New sorting modes were added (Ctrl-F12).
[+] Ctrl-F inserts the full exe pathname into the command line.
[+] Parent PID is displayed in Win9x/ME.
[*] Process "size", date and time are displayed in the status line
[*] Version info added.
[*] History in the Select Computer dialog added.
[-] Far crashed on attempt to view process info from the Search Results dialog.
[-] Switching to another process didn't work under Windows 98+.
[-] You cannot switch to hidden windows now; also, visible windows
    take priority to appear in the Description column.
[-] Data with international characters were displayed incorrectly.


FARCmds
~~~~~~~
[+] New commands "macro:save", "macro:load", "macro:post" and "ln:".
[!] The separator between the command and its parameters can now be
    configured only through the registry.
[-] The "goto" command was unable to handle a path containing spaces
    if it was not quoted.
[-] Incorrect handling of square brackets in the "edit:" command (for
    example, for a file named [1].txt).


TmpPanel
~~~~~~~~~
[!] The command line syntax has been changed. The new syntax doesn't
    cause ambiguities when opening list files with names starting
    with characters A or R.
[+] New configuration option specifying whether the "Temporary panel"
    item is added to the plugins menu.
[+] If the option "Use common panel" is turned on, the plugin allows
    to use up to 10 panels, each of them containing a separate list
    of files. To switch between panels, one can use a menu
    (Alt-Shift-F12) or hotkeys for direct switching (Alt-Shift-0 to
    Alt-Shift-9.
[+] The option "New panel for search results" (works when "Use common
    panel" is enabled) allows to put the search results (Alt-F7 ->
    Panel) to a free temporary panel. This allows to save the results
    of multiple search operations and work with them at the same time.
[+] The hotkey Alt-Shift-F2 allows to save the current contents of
    the panel to a list file.
[+] The option "Safe panel mode" disables all operations with panel
    elements (copying, moving, deleting etc.), except for changing
    into a directory and copying names to the command line.
[+] The option "Any elements in panel" turns off checks for filename
    validity before a file is added to the panel. Pressing Enter on
    a line that doesn't correspond to a real filename copies the
    line to the FAR command line.
[+] New option "Menu from file list". If this option is enabled,
    pressing Enter on a list file doesn't open a panel, but rather
    shows a menu containing all lines in the list file.
[+] It is possible to configure column types and widths for the
    temporary panel and the status line.
[+] Option "Full screen mode".
[+] Now the list file is searched not only in the current directory
    but also in the directories accessible through %PATH%.
[+] It is now possible to capture a list of files written to the
    standard output stream by an external program and to put those
    files to the temporary panel.
[-] List files with empty first line were handled incorrectly.
[-] The panel number was shown incorrectly if both FAR panels had
    the TmpPanel plugin open.

PrintMan
~~~~~~~~
[-] <Line feed> was sent to the printer after each 8k


Advanced Compare
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[!] The names of the HLF and LNG files have been changed back to the
    ones used in FAR 1.65 (CmpEng.hlf/CmpRus.hlf,
    CompEng.lng/CompRus.lng).
[!] The plugin is supplied with source code (see
    PlugDoc.rar::Examples\Compare).
[+] File name processing speed has been increased by
     - using sorted file name lists for directories;
     - comparing directory contents during recursive processing
       instead of building the full list of files in a subtree right
       from the start
[*] The width of the dialog in which the name of the currently
    compared element is shown is selected dynamically based on the
    current console height.
[*] If there are no selected items on either panel, the option
    "Selected items only" is marked as disabled.
[*] To further speed up processing:
     - the dialog with the names of compared files is redrawn at most
       1..2 times per second;
     - checking for Esc is done also 1..2 times per second.
[+] While comparing, the title of the console window shows "Comparing
    files..."
[*] When file contents is compared, the files are now opened with the
    option FILE_SHARE_WRITE.


FARFtp
~~~~~~
[!] New advanced options configurable through the Windows registry
    (see "TechInfoFTP.txt")
[!] A new feature "resume all", and a corresponding button in the
    overwrite dialog. (The button "resume" is shown only if the server
    supports resuming. The possibility of resuming is now shown in the
    information window.)
[!] Changed the mechanism for editing and using the data in host records.
    The username and password now have separate edit fields in the dialog,
    and the data entered in those fields takes precedence over the username
    and password specified in the host name string.
[!] Changed the mechanism for saving host records to the registry:
     - if a record with a duplicate host name is entered, it no longer
       silently overwrites the old record;
     - there is no limit on the number of records with the same host
       name;
     - all existing records will be automatically converted to the new
       format as soon as the user confirms the change (presses OK in the
       host parameters dialog)
     - changed/improved the mechanism for exporting records
     - exporting a folder with a description from the plugin panel
       to a file causes the description to be lost
[!] The plugin does not work in passive mode all the time.
[!] Any operation can be interrupted by pressing Esc at any time.
    Ctrl-Break can no longer be used to interrupt operations. It is
    also possible to show an interrupt confirmation (see TechInfoFTP.txt
    #4).
[+] Advanced FTP command window. The size of the window is
    configurable (see TechInfoFTP.txt #5, #6)
[+] Possibility of keeping a log of the FTP server commands and
    responses (see TechInfoFTP.txt #8, #9, #16).
[+] Possibility to beep after long operations (see TechInfoFTP.txt#11).
[+] Pressing Ctrl+F on a file in the FTP panel now generates a full
    URL with all information about the file, including the username and
    the password.
[+] It is now possible to specify descriptions also for folders
    in the hosts panel. (There is a new field in the "Make folder" dialog,
    and it is disabled when a directory on the FTP server is created.)
    The description can be added or edited by pressing F4 on the folder
    name.
[+] Two new columns in the hosts list: path and username.
[+] Added display of the current and total bytes copied in the copy dialog
    (can be turned off by the rule TechInfoFTP.txt #18)
[*] All possible text messages have been moved from the plugin code
    to language files.
[*] Possibility to configure the digits separator in the copy dialog
    (see TechInfoFTP.txt#1, #2). If the separator is set to 0, its value
    is taken from the locale settings for the current user.
[*] The password text is never shown in the panel caption, log or the
    command window. It is replaced with the string "*hidden*".
[*] Changed the algorithm for sorting host records: now the records are
    compared by server name, then by user name, then by description, and
    so on (that is, if the server names are equal, the user names are
    compared, and so on).
[*] The entry ".." is now shown in the hosts panel.
[*] Changed the algorithm for displaying numbers when copying: the size
    of the copy dialog is now selected automatically based on the size
    of the largest number, and the maximum value that can be correctly
    displayed is 2^64.
[*] When counting the size of files to be copied, the message "Scanning..."
    is no longer shown.
[*] The status of the active scanning operation is now displayed in the
    lower part of the FTP command window.
[*] The plugin version information now contains the version of the
    plugin in the FileVersion field and the version of FAR in the
    ProductVersion field.
[*] Numbers displaying the current CPS are abbreviated to Mbytes and Kbytes.
[*] Idle mode information can be displayed in the console title or on the
    screen (TechInfoFTP.txt#19)
[*] The plugin panel mode is saved and restored when the plugin is next
    activated.
[*] All settings are saved to the registry when the configuration dialog
    is closed by pressing "Ok"
[*] A correct error message is shown if the socket library initialization
    fails.
[-] Could not connect to some sites (for example, to those that showed
    greetings with Cyrillic characters).
[-] Did not work correctly with the "Advanced Compare" plugin.
[-] If an operation is interrupted by the user, breaks the connection.
[-] Does not continue download or upload operations if the previous
    operation was interrupted by the user.
[-] Entered data was lost if the host name was left empty in the host
    parameters dialog.
[-] Copying to/from the hosts panel handles directories correctly.
[-] The plugin no longer crashes when getting the URL of the current
    element.
[-] Does not delete files from FTP if the server does not support
    relative file paths.
[-] When the connection is cancelled, the plugin does not close altogether,
    but returns to the hosts panel instead.
[-] Directory shortcuts pointing to the hosts panel of the plugin did not
    work.
[-] Copying host records from one instance of the plugin to another instance
    opened on the passive panel did not work.
[-] The plugin crashed when trying to upload a file through a symbolic link.
[-] Does not connect if the file "services" is removed or renamed in the
    Windows system directory.


HlfViewer
~~~~~~~~~
[+] New option specifying whether unsaved changes are shown when
    invoking HlfViewer from the internal editor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAR 1.70 beta 3 (build 591) (19.04.2001)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EMenu
~~~~~
[+] New plugin, allowing to run Windows Explorer context menu commands for
    the current file/folder on a FAR Manager panel.
[!] The plugin works only under FAR 1.70 build 321 or later.
[+] If possible, all context menu items are shown.
[-] The shortcut key in the menu caption was highlighted, though it's not
    needed there at all.
[-] File selection is not lost.
[+] Backspace, Ctrl-Left, Ctrl-PgUp - jump to the previous menu
[+] Space, Ctrl-Right, Ctrl-PgDn - works the same as pressing Enter
[+] The menu caption always shows the file name.
[+] Graphical menu instead of text (optional).

Network
~~~~~~~
[+] An informational message is shown while performing long operations.
[!] The "memory" mechanism is removed (it made the plugin unusable)
[+] It is possible to show hidden system shares under Windows NT/2000.
[!] Now pressing Ctrl-PgUp or changing to the directory ".." of the root
    directory of an UNC disk shows the corresponding share in the Network
    Browser. (Works only for Microsoft Windows networks.)
[+] Now it is possible to go to the list of shares of a server by entering
    in the command line
      net:<server name>
    or
      net:\\<server name>
    or (when the plugin is open)
      cd \\<server name>
    (Works only for Microsoft Windows networks.)
[*] Now the current network path is shown in the panel title.
[*] Correct handling of Ctrl-F.
[-] Now pressing F3 or Alt-F3 in the Network Browser panel is ignored.
    Earlier it caused a full network scan, which took a lot of time and
    was completely unnecessary.
[+] The option "Skip top level screen" is replaced with the option "Show
    local network". If this option is enabled, then, when the Network
    Browser is first opened, it will show the network neighborhood of
    the current computer (computers in the same domain or workgroup).
    The option works only for Microsoft Windows networks.
[+] It is possible to toggle the connection type (permanent/temporary) in
    the drive letter selection menu (F6/Shift-F6).
[+] Added a dialog to confirm unmapping a network drive. The dialog allows
    to choose whether the mapping should be restored at logon. The
    respective option from the configuration dialog has been deleted.
[*] Now when trying to enter an unavailable resource, the plugin checks
    the availability before changing the directory, and not after that.
    Thus the situation when an empty panel is shown is excluded.

Advanced Compare
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[*] All functions present in the FSF (FAR Standard Functions) were removed
    from the plugin sources; now the plugin works only under FAR 1.70.
[*] Small optimizations of loops, checks and function calls.
[*] When checking for Esc, CONIN$ is used instead of the standard input -
    for the unlikely case that someone will run FAR with standard input
    redirection.
[-] The flag "two seconds precision" had an opposite effect.
[-] Memory leak after interrupting a subdirectory compare by pressing Esc.
[-] When comparing file contents, Esc interrupted only the compare of the
    current file, but not the process as a whole.
[-] Comparing files on panels (when neither file contents nor
    subdirectories were compared) couldn't be interrupted by pressing Esc,
    no matter how many files there are.
[*] When comparing files on the panels and in each subdirectory checking
    for Esc is done only once after every 256 compares - to reduce the
    overhead of calling console input reading functions. When comparing
    file contents, the check is done after reading each block (32K) -
    a disk operation takes much longer than any console operations.
[*] When interrupting the compare by pressing Esc, the panel selection is
    not changed, so as not to give partially incorrect results to the
    user. Possibly a future version of the plugin will have an option to
    control this behaviour.
[+] Added options "Process selected items only" and "Display message when
    no differences found". The option "Process selected items only" is
    ignored for panels on which nothing is selected - in this case the
    entire contents of the panel is compared.
[+] If at least one of the panels is a plugin panel, the message saying
    that "Two usual file panels are required for this operation" when trying
    to compare file contents or subdirectories is not shown, but instead the
    options for comparing contents or subdirectories are shown as
    "disabled" and "deselected".

FileCase
~~~~~~~~
[+] Can process subdirectories.
[+] Works on the temporary panel. Changes the file case, but this is not
    displayed by the temporary panel (this is a feature of the temporary
    panel).

Brackets
~~~~~~~~
[*] The rule "after bracket" has lower priority than "on bracket":
    > Incorrectly jumps on brackets in cases if there are enclosed
    > brackets of different types, for example:
    >   (myarray[x])
    > Cursor jumps from the closing round bracket to the opening square
    > bracket.

MultiArc
~~~~~~~~
[!] Default settings for the ARJ.FMT module are changed in view of
    last versions of ARJ archiver.
[+] The background process window is minimized.
[*] Continious reset of the "Background" option.

FARCmds
~~~~~~~
[+] The leading spaces are removed in the command being processed.

[+] New command "whereis" - find and jump to the given object
[+] When capturing the output of external programs, it is possible to
    capture the text written by a program directly to the console
    (and not through the standard output stream). This screen output
    can be seen after pressing Ctrl+O if the prefix "<<" was specified
    instead of "<" or if the respective option is enabled in the
    plugin settings.
[+] It is possible to execute an external command in a directory
    different from the current directory by specifying "|path|command"

    standard printing code of the FAR Manager is used.

HlfViewer
~~~~~~~~~
[-] Bug when searching in archives (OpenFilePlugin). As a result, pressing
    Enter on a HLF file no longer views it. If you want this feature to
    come back, you should create an association for *.hlf files with the
    following Execute command: hlf:!.!
[*] Hyperlinks are handled correctly in help files opened from plugins
    (for example, HLFViewer).

TmpPanel
~~~~~~~~~
[+] It is possible to specify that the list file is in the ANSI codepage -
    for this you should capitalize the first letter of the command (see

ProcList
~~~~~~~~
[+] You can view the process list on remote machines running under Windows
    NT or Windows 2000 (by pressing the F6 key). You must have Administrator
    privileges to use this feature. To view remote processes from
    Windows 95/98/ME, you must have access to the remote machine's registry
    (winreg.dll is required for that). Shift-F6 returns to the local machine.
[+] You can raise and lower the priority class for local processes
    (Shift-F1/Shift-F2).
[+] The number of threads and several performance counters are shown
    in View mode for local and remote machines running NT or Windows 2000.
    (The number of counters depends on the OS version of the target machine.)
    Full pathnames are shown in this mode too (local machines only).
[+] The process command line and environment are shown in View mode
    for local machines running NT/2000.
[+] The process I/O counters and the count of GUI object handles
    are shown in View mode for local machines running Windows 2000.

    in a separate console window.
[+] ACE.fmt - FAR archive support module for the ACE archiver.
    Because of some incompatibility of different versions of ACE, some archive
    commands may not work correctly. It occurs because of new keys appeared
    in the new version (the plugin is designed to work with ACE 1.2a).
    If you receive an error message, go in FAR in:
    Options|Plugins configuration|Archive support|Command lines|ACE
    and remove everywhere you find the parameter {-t %%W}.
