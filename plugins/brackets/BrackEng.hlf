$ #Brackets matching#
  This plugin allows you to:

  - find a matching bracket;
  - select the text between brackets.

  The plugin can work in three cases:

  #1. Common '()', '{}', '[]', '<>' and quotation marks#
     This is a simple case - when the cursor is on a bracket, it is
     positioned to the matching bracket. For quotation marks it is
     also necessary to specify the scanning direction - forward or
     backward.

  #2. Uncommon '()', '{}', '[]' and '<>'#
     This case is when the cursor stands on the next character after
     the bracket. The plugin also positions the cursor to the
     matching bracket. Handling of this case can be disabled in the
     configuration dialog.

  #3. Double brackets#
     This case allows to handle, for example, block comments from
     the C/C++ language: '/*' and '*/'. The cursor will be positioned
     to the respective character of the matching bracket.

@Find
$ #Brackets matching - Search/select#

  #Search#     - if the matching bracket is found successfully, the
               cursor will be positioned to the bracket.

  #Select#     - if the matching bracket is found successfully, the
               cursor will be positioned to the bracket and the text
               between the brackets (including the brackets
               themselves) will be selected.

@Direct
$ #Brackets matching - Search for quotation marks#
  If the matching brackets or quotation marks are the same characters,
the plugin needs to know the direction of file scanning:

  #Forward#    - search for the matching character from the current
               cursor position to the end of the text.

  #Backward#   - search for the matching symbol from the current
               cursor position to the beginning of the text.

$ #Brackets matching - Configure#
  If you don't like the default settings of the plugin, you can configure
it.

  #>Rules#
  The rules control the behavior of the plugin in specific situations:

   #Ignore brackets#      If this option is enabled, the plugin does
   #in quotation marks#   not locate the brackets that are embraced
                        in quotation marks: #'#{#'#.
                        The quotation mark characters are also
                        configurable.

   #Do not jump when#     If this option is disabled, the plugin
   #after a bracket#      searches for the matching bracket also
                        when the cursor is on the next character
                        after the bracket. If the option is
                        enabled, the plugin performs the search
                        only if the cursor is precisely at the
                        bracket.

   #Priority of single#   If this option is enabled, the plugin
   #brackets#             first uses the rules for single brackets
                        (for example, if the cursor is at the
                        first character of '#<%#', the plugin
                        tries to locate '#>#' as the matching
                        bracket). When the option is disabled,
                        the plugin tries to locate '#%>#' in
                        this situation.

   #Go to bracket#        When selecting a block between brackets,
   #when selecting#       set cursor to the found bracket.

   #Beep if matched#      Beep after successful search.


  #>Definitions#
  This section allows to change some basic constants of the plugin:

   #Single brackets#      Definition of single brackets.
                        Contains a sequence of two-character pairs.
                        The first character is the opening bracket,
                        the second - the closing bracket. There
                        can be at most 10 pairs. The first and second
                        characters can be the same (for example,
                        #""# or #''#).

   #Double brackets#      Definition of double brackets.
                        Contains a sequence of four-character groups.
                        The first two characters are the opening
                        bracket, the second - the closing bracket.
                        There can be at most 10 groups.

   #Quotation marks#      Quotation mark characters for the rule
                        "Ignore brackets in quotation marks".
                        Contains a sequence of two-character pairs.
                        The first character is the opening quotation
                        mark, the second - the closing mark. There
                        can be at most 10 pairs. Note: the quotation
                        marks are not used directly for bracket
                        matching.
