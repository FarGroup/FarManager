===============================================================================

This plugin development kit (PDK) is compatible with Dragon UnPACKer 5.0.0 RC3:
Dragon UnPACKer Driver Interface (DUDI) v3

It will not work with older versions.
It will work for any future DUP5 supporting DUDI v3 (most likely any future
Dragon UnPACKer v5.x).

Needed:
-------

You need a Delphi compiler. The Borland Delphi Personnal Edition (which is
free) version 6 or 7 will do the job.
You obviously also need some Delphi programming skills. :P
I have tried to use "stdcall" for all exported functions of the DLL. So it
might be possible to make plugins in other languages like C/C++.


Included:
---------

drv_none.dpr         Example of a Driver Plugin for DUP5
dup5drv_data.pas     Optional Data handling unit
dup5drv_utils        DUP5 Driver Structures (needed)
