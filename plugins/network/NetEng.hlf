$ #Network browser plugin.#
    Using the network browser you can navigate through a network,
go to mapped and unmapped network disks, map and unmap them.
Press #F5# to map selected disks to the next available letters
or #F6# to choose letters manually. #Shift-F5# and #Shift-F6#
work the same as #F5# and #F6#, but create temporary connections.
It is possible to toggle the connection type in the drive letter
selection menu shown when #F6# or #Shift-F6# is pressed.
Use #F8# to ~discard existing mapping~@DisconnectDrive@ for selected disks.

    You can open the network browser from the disks menu,
the plugins menu or by entering a command in the command line:

    #net:#
  or
    #net:server_name#
  or
    #net:\\server_name#

    If you specify the name of the server when opening the plugin
from the command line, the list of shares of that server will be shown.
This feature works only for Microsoft Windows networks.

    Within the plugin, you can move between servers by entering a
command in the command line:

    #cd \\server_name#

    This feature also works only for Microsoft Windows networks.

    You can use different credentials to open remote shares. To open resource
specifying login information explicitly use F4 key.

    This feature may not work on Windows 95/98/Me systems.
