$ #Advanced compare#
 This plugin is similar to the internal Far "Compare folders" command, but it also provides additional compare options:

 #Process:#

 #subfolders#
 Compare files in subfolders. Cannot be used for plugin panels.

 #maximum folder depth#
 Don't compare folders of bigger depth than specified.

 #selected items only#
 Compare selected files/folders only. This option is ignored for panels with no selected items (the whole panel contents will be compared in that case).

 #Compare:#

 #time#
 Compare file modification time. Unlike the internal Far command, this option will mark files on both panels, not the newer files only.

 #two seconds precision#
 Compare with two seconds precision. Otherwise complete file time, including milliseconds, will be compared.

 #ignore possible time zone differences#
 Ignore file time difference that is an exact multiple of 15 minutes (i.e. half an hour, 2 hours and 15 minutes, 12 hours). Maximum ignored difference is 26 hours.

 #size#
 Compare file size.

 #contents#
 Compare file contents. Cannot be used for plugin panels.

 #ignore differences in new line characters#
 Ignore differences in new line characters (i.e. when comparing Unix and Windows files).

 #ignore whitespace#
 Ignore whitespace when comparing file contents (ignores spaces, tabs and new line characters).

 #Display a message if no differences were found#
 Display a message if all compared items seem to be identical.
