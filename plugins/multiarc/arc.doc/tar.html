  <h2>8.4 The Standard Format</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <em>(This message will disappear, once this node revised.)</em>
  </blockquote>
  <p>While an archive may contain many files, the archive itself is a single
  ordinary file. Like any other file, an archive file can be written to a
  storage device such as a tape or disk, sent through a pipe or over a network,
  saved on the active file system, or even stored in another archive. An archive
  file is not easy to read or manipulate without using the <code>tar</code>
  utility or Tar mode in GNU Emacs.</p>
  <p>Physically, an archive consists of a series of file entries terminated by
  an end-of-archive entry, which consists of 512 zero bytes. A file entry
  usually describes one of the files in the archive (an <em>archive member</em>),
  and consists of a file header and the contents of the file. File headers
  contain file names and statistics, checksum information which <code>tar</code>
  uses to detect file corruption, and information about file types.</p>
  <p>Archives are permitted to have more than one member with the same member
  name. One way this situation can occur is if more than one version of a file
  has been stored in the archive. For information about adding new versions of a
  file to an archive, see <a href="tar.html#SEC55">4.2.4 Updating an Archive</a>,
  and to learn more about having more than one archive member with the same name,
  see -backup node, when it's written .</p>
  <p>In addition to entries describing archive members, an archive may contain
  entries which <code>tar</code> itself uses to store information. See section <a href="tar.html#SEC139">9.7
  Including a Label in the Archive</a>, for an example of such an archive entry.</p>
  <p>A <code>tar</code> archive file contains a series of blocks. Each block
  contains <code>BLOCKSIZE</code> bytes. Although this format may be thought of
  as being on magnetic tape, other media are often used.</p>
  <p>Each file archived is represented by a header block which describes the
  file, followed by zero or more blocks which give the contents of the file. At
  the end of the archive file there may be a block filled with binary zeros as
  an end-of-file marker. A reasonable system should write a block of zeros at
  the end, but must not assume that such a block exists when reading an archive.</p>
  <p>The blocks may be <em>blocked</em> for physical I/O operations. Each record
  of <var>n</var> blocks (where <var>n</var> is set by the <kbd>--blocking-factor=<var>512-size</var></kbd>
  (<kbd>-b <var>512-size</var></kbd>) option to <code>tar</code>) is written
  with a single <samp>`write ()'</samp> operation. On magnetic tapes, the result
  of such a write is a single record. When writing an archive, the last record
  of blocks should be written at the full size, with blocks after the zero block
  containing all zeros. When reading an archive, a reasonable system should
  properly handle an archive whose last record is shorter than the rest, or
  which contains garbage records after a zero block.</p>
  <p>The header block is defined in C as follows. In the GNU <code>tar</code>
  distribution, this is part of file <tt>`src/tar.h'</tt>:</p>

</pre>

  <p>All characters in header blocks are represented by using 8-bit characters
  in the local variant of ASCII. Each field within the structure is contiguous;
  that is, there is no padding used within the structure. Each character on the
  archive medium is stored contiguously.</p>
  <p>Bytes representing the contents of files (after the header block of each
  file) are not translated in any way and are not constrained to represent
  characters in any character set. The <code>tar</code> format does not
  distinguish text files from binary files, and no translation of file contents
  is performed.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>name</b></code>, <code><b>linkname</b></code>,<b> <code>magic</code></b>,
  <code><b>uname</b></code>, and <code><b>gname</b></code> are null-terminated
  character strings. All other fileds are zero-filled octal numbers in ASCII.
  Each numeric field of width <var>w</var> contains <var>w</var> minus 2 digits,
  a space, and a null, except <code><b>size</b></code>, and <code><b>mtime</b></code>,
  which do not contain the trailing null.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>name</b></code> field is the file name of the file, with
  directory names (if any) preceding the file name, separated by slashes.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>mode</b></code> field provides nine bits specifying file
  permissions and three bits to specify the Set UID, Set GID, and Save Text (<em>sticky</em>)
  modes. Values for these bits are defined above. When special permissions are
  required to create a file with a given mode, and the user restoring files from
  the archive does not hold such permissions, the mode bit(s) specifying those
  special permissions are ignored. Modes which are not supported by the
  operating system restoring files from the archive will be ignored. Unsupported
  modes should be faked up when creating or updating an archive; e.g. the group
  permission could be copied from the <em>other</em> permission.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>uid</b></code> and <code><b>gid</b></code> fields are the
  numeric user and group ID of the file owners, respectively. If the operating
  system does not support numeric user or group IDs, these fields should be
  ignored.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>size</b></code> field is the size of the file in bytes; linked
  files are archived with this field specified as zero. Modifiers <strong>&lt;/&gt;</strong>
  , in particular the <kbd>--incremental</kbd> (<kbd>-G</kbd>) option.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>mtime</b></code> field is the modification time of the file at
  the time it was archived. It is the ASCII representation of the octal value of
  the last time the file was modified, represented as an integer number of
  seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00 Coordinated Universal Time.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>chksum</b></code> field is the ASCII representation of the
  octal value of the simple sum of all bytes in the header block. Each 8-bit
  byte in the header is added to an unsigned integer, initialized to zero, the
  precision of which shall be no less than seventeen bits. When calculating the
  checksum, the <code>chksum</code> field is treated as if it were all blanks.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>typeflag</b></code> field specifies the type of file archived.
  If a particular implementation does not recognize or permit the specified type,
  the file will be extracted as if it were a regular file. As this action occurs,
  <code>tar</code> issues a warning to the standard error.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>atime</b></code> and <code><b>ctime</b></code> fields are used
  in making incremental backups; they store, respectively, the particular file's
  access time and last inode-change time.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>offset</b></code> is used by the <kbd>--multi-volume</kbd> (<kbd>-M</kbd>)
  option, when making a multi-volume archive. The offset is number of bytes into
  the file that we need to restart at to continue the file on the next tape, i.e.,
  where we store the location that a continued file is continued at.</p>
  <p>The following fields were added to deal with sparse files. A file is <em>sparse</em>
  if it takes in unallocated blocks which end up being represented as zeros, i.e.,
  no useful data. A test to see if a file is sparse is to look at the number
  blocks allocated for it versus the number of characters in the file; if there
  are fewer blocks allocated for the file than would normally be allocated for a
  file of that size, then the file is sparse. This is the method <code>tar</code>
  uses to detect a sparse file, and once such a file is detected, it is treated
  differently from non-sparse files.</p>
  <p>Sparse files are often <code>dbm</code> files, or other database-type files
  which have data at some points and emptiness in the greater part of the file.
  Such files can appear to be very large when an <samp>`ls -l'</samp> is done on
  them, when in truth, there may be a very small amount of important data
  contained in the file. It is thus undesirable to have <code>tar</code> think
  that it must back up this entire file, as great quantities of room are wasted
  on empty blocks, which can lead to running out of room on a tape far earlier
  than is necessary. Thus, sparse files are dealt with so that these empty
  blocks are not written to the tape. Instead, what is written to the tape is a
  description, of sorts, of the sparse file: where the holes are, how big the
  holes are, and how much data is found at the end of the hole. This way, the
  file takes up potentially far less room on the tape, and when the file is
  extracted later on, it will look exactly the way it looked beforehand. The
  following is a description of the fields used to handle a sparse file:</p>
  <p>The <code><b>sp</b></code> is an array of <code>struct sparse</code>. Each <code>struct
  sparse</code> contains two 12-character strings which represent an offset into
  the file and a number of bytes to be written at that offset. The offset is
  absolute, and not relative to the offset in preceding array element.</p>
  <p>The header can hold four of these <code>struct sparse</code> at the moment;
  if more are needed, they are not stored in the header.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>isextended</b></code> flag is set when an <code>extended_header</code>
  is needed to deal with a file. Note that this means that this flag can only be
  set when dealing with a sparse file, and it is only set in the event that the
  description of the file will not fit in the alloted room for sparse structures
  in the header. In other words, an extended_header is needed.</p>
  <p>The <code><b>extended_header</b></code> structure is used for sparse files
  which need more sparse structures than can fit in the header. The header can
  fit 4 such structures; if more are needed, the flag <code>isextended</code>
  gets set and the next block is an <code>extended_header</code>.</p>
  <p>Each <code><b>extended_header</b></code> structure contains an array of 21 sparse
  structures, along with a similar <code>isextended</code> flag that the header
  had. There can be an indeterminate number of such <code>extended_header</code>s
  to describe a sparse file.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;
  <dl compact>
    <dt><code>REGTYPE</code>
    <dd>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>AREGTYPE</code>
    <dd>These flags represent a regular file. In order to be compatible with
      older versions of <code>tar</code>, a <code>typeflag</code> value of <code>AREGTYPE</code>
      should be silently recognized as a regular file. New archives should be
      created using <code>REGTYPE</code>. Also, for backward compatibility, <code>tar</code>
      treats a regular file whose name ends with a slash as a directory.
      <p>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>LNKTYPE</code>
    <dd>This flag represents a file linked to another file, of any type,
      previously archived. Such files are identified in Unix by each file having
      the same device and inode number. The linked-to name is specified in the <code>linkname</code>
      field with a trailing null.
      <p>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>SYMTYPE</code>
    <dd>This represents a symbolic link to another file. The linked-to name is
      specified in the <code>linkname</code> field with a trailing null.
      <p>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>CHRTYPE</code>
    <dd>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>BLKTYPE</code>
    <dd>These represent character special files and block special files
      respectively. In this case the <code>devmajor</code> and <code>devminor</code>
      fields will contain the major and minor device numbers respectively.
      Operating systems may map the device specifications to their own local
      specification, or may ignore the entry.
      <p>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>DIRTYPE</code>
    <dd>This flag specifies a directory or sub-directory. The directory name in
      the <code>name</code> field should end with a slash. On systems where disk
      allocation is performed on a directory basis, the <code>size</code> field
      will contain the maximum number of bytes (which may be rounded to the
      nearest disk block allocation unit) which the directory may hold. A <code>size</code>
      field of zero indicates no such limiting. Systems which do not support
      limiting in this manner should ignore the <code>size</code> field.
      <p>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>FIFOTYPE</code>
    <dd>This specifies a FIFO special file. Note that the archiving of a FIFO
      file archives the existence of this file and not its contents.
      <p>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>CONTTYPE</code>
    <dd>This specifies a contiguous file, which is the same as a normal file
      except that, in operating systems which support it, all its space is
      allocated contiguously on the disk. Operating systems which do not allow
      contiguous allocation should silently treat this type as a normal file.
      <p>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>A</code> <small>...</small> <code>Z</code>
    <dd>These are reserved for custom implementations. Some of these are used in
      the GNU modified format, as described below.
      <p>&nbsp;
  </dl>
  <p>Other values are reserved for specification in future revisions of the
  P1003 standard, and should not be used by any <code>tar</code> program.</p>
  <p>The <code>magic</code> field indicates that this archive was output in the
  P1003 archive format. If this field contains <code>TMAGIC</code>, the <code>uname</code>
  and <code>gname</code> fields will contain the ASCII representation of the
  owner and group of the file respectively. If found, the user and group IDs are
  used rather than the values in the <code>uid</code> and <code>gid</code>
  fields.</p>

  <h2>8.5 GNU Extensions to the Archive Format</h2>
  <p>GNU-формат использует дополнительные файловые тип, описывающие новые типы файлов в архиве. Они указаны ниже.</p>
  <dl compact>
    <dt><code>GNUTYPE_DUMPDIR</code>
    <dd>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>'D'</code>
    <dd>This represents a directory and a list of files created by the <kbd>--incremental</kbd>
      (<kbd>-G</kbd>) option. The <code>size</code> field gives the total size
      of the associated list of files. Each file name is preceded by either a <samp>`Y'</samp>
      (the file should be in this archive) or an <samp>`N'</samp>. (The file is
      a directory, or is not stored in the archive.) Each file name is
      terminated by a null. There is an additional null after the last file name.
      <p>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>GNUTYPE_MULTIVOL</code>
    <dd>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>'M'</code>
    <dd>This represents a file continued from another volume of a multi-volume
      archive created with the <kbd>--multi-volume</kbd> (<kbd>-M</kbd>) option.
      The original type of the file is not given here. The <code>size</code>
      field gives the maximum size of this piece of the file (assuming the
      volume does not end before the file is written out). The <code>offset</code>
      field gives the offset from the beginning of the file where this part of
      the file begins. Thus <code>size</code> plus <code>offset</code> should
      equal the original size of the file.
      <p>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>GNUTYPE_SPARSE</code>
    <dd>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>'S'</code>
    <dd>This flag indicates that we are dealing with a sparse file. Note that
      archiving a sparse file requires special operations to find holes in the
      file, which mark the positions of these holes, along with the number of
      bytes of data to be found after the hole.
      <p>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>GNUTYPE_VOLHDR</code>
    <dd>&nbsp;
    <dt><code>'V'</code>
    <dd>This file type is used to mark the volume header that was given with the
      <kbd>--label=<var>archive-label</var></kbd> (<kbd>-V <var>archive-label</var></kbd>)
      option when the archive was created. The <code>name</code> field contains
      the <code>name</code> given after the <kbd>--label=<var>archive-label</var></kbd>
      (<kbd>-V <var>archive-label</var></kbd>) option. The <code>size</code>
      field is zero. Only the first file in each volume of an archive should
      have this type.
      <p>&nbsp;
  </dl>
  <p>You may have trouble reading a GNU format archive on a non-GNU system if
  the options <kbd>--incremental</kbd> (<kbd>-G</kbd>), <kbd>--multi-volume</kbd>
  (<kbd>-M</kbd>), <kbd>--sparse</kbd> (<kbd>-S</kbd>), or <kbd>--label=<var>archive-label</var></kbd>
  (<kbd>-V <var>archive-label</var></kbd>) were used when writing the archive.
  In general, if <code>tar</code> does not use the GNU-added fields of the
  header, other versions of <code>tar</code> should be able to read the archive.
  Otherwise, the <code>tar</code> program will give an error, the most likely
  one being a checksum error.</p>
