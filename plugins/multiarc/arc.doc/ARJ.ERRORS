     The following error messages may appear when using ARJ.  A brief
     explanation of each message follows:


     <filename> does not exist

         The file <filename> could not be found on the disk.

         This error may occur in a multiple volume extraction if ARJ is
         trying to extract a split file.  If this split file is not the
         beginning of the file, ARJ will look for the beginning of the
         file on the disk. If this file is missing, ARJ will report this
         error.  To correct this problem, you need to extract the previous
         portion(s) of this file.

         This error will also occur during an extraction to freshen
         existing files.


     <filename> exists

         The file <filename> already exists on the disk.


     <filename> is not an ARJ archive

         The file <filename> does not have a valid ARJ archive header in
         the initial portion of the file.  This file may not be an ARJ
         archive or it may be damaged.


     <filename> is not the same date/time

         The file <filename> that is being appended to does not have the
         correct file date-time stamp.  This message occurs during 
         multiple volume extraction when the portion of the file on disk 
         does not match the portion in the archive.  This can happen if a
         multiple volume extraction was interrupted by a "quit" response.


     <filename> is same or newer

         The file <filename> has the same or newer file date-time stamp
         than the matching file in the archive.


     <filename> is same or older

         The file <filename> has the same or older file date-time stamp
         than the matching file in the archive.


     Already a chapter archive

         The archive being converted to a chapter archive is already a
         chapter archive.


     ANSI codepage archive

         This is a notification message for the user indicating that the 
         archive being created or processed is using the ANSI codepage
         instead of the normal default OEM codepage.  ANSI codepage
         archives created by ARJ32 may not be processed correctly by ARJ 
         for DOS because of filename translation issues.


     Archive codepage mismatch

         The archive being processed was created using a conflicting
         codepage (ANSI or OEM).

         ARJ32 in ANSIPAGE mode (-hy) cannot add files to an archive
         created using the OEM codepage.
         
         ARJ for DOS cannot add files to an archive created using the ANSI 
         codepage.

         Or ARJ attempted to join two archives that use different
         codepages.


     Archive name argument missing

         The ARJ command is missing the name of the ARJ archive filename.


     Arg table overflow

         There are more than 64 arguments on the ARJ command line.


     (ARJ9XRST.EXE) Error (2): File or directory not found.

         For Windows 95/98, the ARJ support program, ARJ9XRST.EXE was not
         installed in one of the PATH directories like C:\WINDOWS or
         C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND.  Applies only to the 32 bit version of ARJ.


     ARJ-PROTECT recovery data slightly damaged. ARJ-PROTECT again.

         ARJ has detected some damage to the ARJ-PROTECT recovery data.
         You should re-test the archive ("t" command) and then
         re-ARJ-PROTECT the archive to generate fresh recovery data.

         Example:  ARJ y archive -hk      remove ARJ-PROTECT
                   ARJ t archive -hk      restore ARJ-PROTECT


     AUTO ARJ-PROTECT disabled

         ARJ-PROTECT will no longer be automatically done when an archive
         is updated.


     AUTO ARJ-PROTECT enabled

         The archive has been set for AUTO ARJ-PROTECT.  This means that
         the next time the archive is updated, ARJ will automatically
         ARJ-PROTECT the archive.

         This message does not indicate the presence of valid ARJ-PROTECT
         data in the archive.  The ARJ "t" command can be used to test for
         valid ARJ-PROTECT data.


     Bad command syntax

         The ARJ command line is not correct syntactically.  The chosen
         command or option is not supported.


     Bad file data

         The file in the ARJ archive is damaged and has invalid data in 
         it. It is not possible to recover this file in an undamaged 
         format.


     Bad file data or bad password

         The file in the ARJ archive is damaged or you may have supplied
         the wrong password to the "-g" option.  Check the password that
         you specified.


     Bad header

         The ARJ archive file description information record is damaged.


     Bad or missing SECURITY key

         An invalid or missing security key was provided to ARJ.  Check to 
         see if the security key is correct.


     Break signaled

         The user pressed Control C or Control BREAK.


     Can't add a chapter label for size reasons

         ARJ could not complete the conversion of a standard archive to a 
         chapter archive because there was not enough space allocated or 
         specified to add the chapter label.


     Can't ARJ-PROTECT an existing unprotected removable volume archive

         ARJ-PROTECTING an existing multiple volume archive on removable
         media would cause volumes to overflow the volume size limit, so 
         this is not allowed except for volumes on fixed media (hard disk 
         drive).
     

     Can't filename comment a dual-name archive

         A dual-name archive stores its long filenames in the filename
         comment field; therefore, that field is not available for storing 
         comments about the individual file.

         To comment (main comment) a dual-name archive, you must use the
         "-z" option as in:

         ARJ c dual-name -z

     
     Can't combine mismatched archives (dual-name)

         ARJ attempted to join a dual-name archive with one that is not a 
         dual-name archive.


     Can't convert an archive to a dual-name archive

         A dual-name archive must be so designated at the initial archive
         creation.  An already existing archive cannot be converted since
         the alternate filenames have not been stored in the archive.


     Can't copy temp <filename> to archive <filename>

         This error usually means that there is not enough disk space to
         copy the intermediate archive file to its destination drive. ARJ
         does not purge the intermediate archive file in this situation so
         that the file can be copied manually to a drive with enough disk
         space.


     Can't delete <filename>

         ARJ cannot delete the file <filename>.  Most likely, the file is
         in use or is set as readonly.


     Can't find <filename>

         The file <filename> does not exist.


     Can't find damage in <filename>

         Message changed to "No damage found in <filename>".


     Can't find restart file: <filename>

         The file <filename> does not exist.


     Can't find restart information

         During the scan of the specified index file, ARJ could not find a 
         line of text similar to the following:

         Next volume - 001 1      19931 C:\ARC\VGA640.DRV

         This can happened if the index file is damaged or was created by
         a version of ARJ prior to 2.39.


     Can't get volume label

         ARJ could not read the volume label of the drive specified.


     Can't handle ARJ-SECURITY version <number>

         This version of ARJ encountered an ARJ-SECURITY envelope version
         of which it does not know how to verify the integrity.


     Can't make directory <directoryname>

         ARJ could not create the directory <directoryname>.  The name
         <directoryname> may already exist or the name may be too long.


     Can't open <filename>

         ARJ cannot open the file <filename>.  The file may be set to
         readonly or it may already be in use.  The "-hq" option may be
         useful in some file-in-use situations.

         In Windows 95, this error may be due to filenames that contain
         symbols for which there is no MS-DOS equivalent.  These symbols
         are converted to "_" underscores in MS-DOS.  DOS programs cannot
         access these files.

         This can also occur when accessing long filenames in Windows 95
         where a storage media or network driver does not provide full
         long filename functionality to the operating system.


     Can't order a multiple volume archive

         Re-ordering a multiple volume archive is NOT allowed.


     Can't read file or unexpected end of file

         This error message usually occurs if the end of the file has been
         reached when ARJ is expecting more data.


     Can't rename <filename> to <filename>

         ARJ could not rename <filename>.  The target filename may already
         exist.


     Can't reset <filename>

         ARJ could not reset the archive bit attribute of <filename>.  
         This error is ignored by ARJ.


     Can't seek to position <number> in file

         ARJ could not seek to the position in the file.  This file may 
         not be as large as the position specified.


     Can't update an ARJ-SECURED archive!

         Modification of an ARJ-SECURED archive is NOT allowed.


     Can't use -jt1 or -jt2 with -e or -e1

         ARJ always uses the filename stored in the archive to access the
         file during the compare operation.  The -e and -e1 options strip
         significant information from the filename.


     Can't use -v with -je1

         The small self-extraction module does not support multiple volume
         archives.


     Can't write file. Disk full?

         Self-explanatory.


     Chapter error (<number>)

         This is an internal error in chapter processing and should not
         happen.  This indicates a problem in the program logic.  Please
         notify ARJ Software, Inc. of this problem.


     CRC error

         The file in the ARJ archive is damaged and has invalid data in 
         it. It is not possible to recover this file in an undamaged 
         format.

         If this error is encountered when ARJ initially starts up, this
         indicates that the ARJ runfile is probably damaged.


     CRC INFO sections damaged

         The ARJ data damage protection data is too damaged to use to
         repair archive damage.


     Critical device error

         A DOS critical error has occurred.  ARJ has trapped this error
         condition and returned a error.


     *** Damaged ARJ-SECURED archive!

         This ARJ archive has been damaged or corrupted.  The contents of
         the archive are not in the same condition as when it was created.

         You should not trust that the contents of this archive are as the
         archive creator intended.


     Delete argument missing

         The ARJ delete command requires that a filename or wildspec be
         specified on the command line.  It does not assume "*.*".


     *** Detected an OBSOLETE ARJ-SECURITY envelope.  NOT verified!

         ARJ has detected a version 1 ARJ-SECURITY envelope.  ARJ has not
         verified the validity of the ARJ-SECURITY envelope because of the 
         obsolescence of version 1 envelopes.


     Encryption module damage

         ARJ could not access the encryption module.  This error may be
         the result of corruption of the encryption module.

     
     Error (2): File or directory not found.

         This error message and others similar to the above message will
         be displayed upon ARJ abnormally terminating.  ARJ will display
         the most recent system error.  This error message may clarify the 
         associated ARJ error message.


     Exceeded chapter limit of <number>

         ARJ only supports up to 250 chapters within a single archive.


     Exceeded maximum path size of <number> at <filename>

         The maximum pathname length is limited in size to <number>
         characters.


     Exceeded name limit of <number> at <filename>

         The number of filenames encountered by ARJ has exceeded the
         documented limited of <number> filenames.


     File is password encrypted

         ARJ is skipping the current file because it is password encrypted
         (garbled) and no password has been specified on the command line
         with the "-g" option.


     File is too large

         ARJ cannot build archives or compress files larger than 2.1 
         gigabytes.  This is a DOS file size limit.  For archives, try 
         building volumes using -v2000M.
          
     
     Found <number> error(s)

         ARJ has encountered <number> non-fatal errors.


     Garbled files are not allowed for SFXJR

         The small self-extractor module does not support the extraction 
         of garbled files.


     GCRYPT internal error

         This error should not occur.  Please notify ARJ Software, Inc.


     Header CRC error

         The file description header record in the archive is damaged.
         This cannot be fixed.  The use of the "-jr" option will allow the
         recovery of files after the damaged section.


     Invalid command: <command>

         The specified <command> is not a valid ARJ command.


     Invalid command or option for chapter archives

         The command or switch option is not appropriate when processing
         chapter archives.  For example, you cannot "j"oin a chapter
         archive.


     Invalid comment header

         This error should never happen.


     Invalid date string: <date>

         The date <date> contains an invalid date.  It should be specified
         in YYMMDDHHMMSS format where YY represents the two digit year, MM
         represents the month, DD represents the day, HH represents the
         hour, MM represents the minutes, and SS represents the seconds.


     Invalid multiple volume file sequence

         ARJ has detected a sequence error in a series of multiple volume
         archives.  This error should never occur.


     Invalid parameter string: <parameter>

         The parameter string <parameter> is not correct syntactically.


     Invalid switch: <option>

         The switch option <option> is not a valid option.


     Invalid use of self-extraction switch

         The -je or -je1 switch was used with a non-modification command.


     Invalid volume size

         The specified volume size was too small or not specified.

         For commands that modify ARJ multiple volumes, a volume size MUST
         be specified with the "-v" option.

         If you are using the "-hk" option, the error message means that
         the volume size specified is too small for the ARJ-PROTECT data
         to be generated.


     Listing error: no free blocks at <pathname>

         This is an ARJ internal error.  Please notify ARJ Software, Inc.


     Listing XMS error: init

         ARJ is unable to allocate XMS memory for its use.


     Listing XMS error: read

         ARJ cannot access a requested XMS memory block.


     Listing XMS error: write

         ARJ cannot store a requested XMS memory block.

         Some Windows 3.x memory "enhancers" may interfere with access to
         XMS memory blocks while in a Windows DOS box.


     Long filenames and/or text mode (-t1) files are not allowed for SFXJR

         The ARJ small self-extraction module (-je1) does not support
         the use of Windows long filenames and the extraction of files 
         compressed in text mode (-t1).  Use of the "-hf" option will
         disable use of long filenames.


     Missing filename argument for <command>

         A filename must be specified for <command>.


     Multiple volume update requires -v

         Since updates to multiple volumes involve putting all changed
         files at the end of the volumes, it is necessary to specify the
         volume switch "-v", so that ARJ will process all the volumes.


     Multiple volume updates are NOT supported (OBSOLETE)

         The modification of ARJ multiple volume archives is not supported
         or recommended.  You can use the "-hu" option to override this
         prohibition.


     Must specify only non-wildnames for order command

         The ARJ order command does not accept wildcards.


     No ARJ-PROTECT recovery data found

         ARJ could not find the ARJ-PROTECT data damage protection 
         information appended to the archive.  ARJ could not find the data
         signature of this information.  Either the archive was never
         actually protected or the ARJ-PROTECT data is too corrupted to 
         process.
     
     
     No available memory to store <filename>

         ARJ has run out of memory and cannot store the name <filename>.
         Specifying fewer filenames or using a listfile are two ways to
         work around the lack of memory.

         The new "-hm" option sets ARJ to use disk space to store this 
         list of filenames thus avoiding this memory problem.


     No damage found in <filename>

         First, this message indicates that this archive is ARJ-PROTECTED.
         
         Second, using the ARJ-PROTECT damage protection data, ARJ could 
         not find any damaged data areas in the ARJ archive <filename>.  
         
         There is a small probability (about 1 in 3 billion) that ARJ 
         cannot detect a corrupted section of data.


     No filename in comment

         The dual-name archive is not properly set up with long and short
         filenames being stored.


     No strings were entered

         At least one search string must be specified for the ARJ "w"
         command.


     Not a chapter archive

         Self-explanatory.

         You can convert a standard archive to a chapter archive with the 
         "cc" command.


     Not a valid method for SFX

         The ARJ self-extraction modules do not support extraction of 
         files compressed with the "-m4" option.


     Not enough disk space

         Self-explanatory.


     Not enough disk space for extraction. Overflow by over <number> bytes.

         Self-explanatory.


     Not enough free disk space

         Self-explanatory.


     NOT found

         This message is displayed when the filename in the archive is not
         found on disk.


     NOT matched

         This message is displayed when the contents of the filename in 
         the archive does not match the contents of the same filename on 
         disk or that a directory in the archive does not exist on disk.


     Nothing to do

         This message is displayed if you try to restart a multiple volume
         archival process that did not abort but actually completed.


     Order command file count mismatch

         This error should not happen.  Please report this problem.


     Out of memory

         There is not enough memory for ARJ to complete its operation.


     Out of near memory

         There is not enough 16 bit memory for ARJ to complete its
         operation.  It can occur if there is a large amount of 
         environment space allocated to environment variables.  The use of 
         "COMMAND /C /E:200 ARJ <command> ... " may work around this 
         problem.


     Password option missing

         The "-g" option requires the specification of a password.


     Passwords did not match

         The two passwords entered did not match exactly.


     Protect internal overflow error

         This error should not occur.  Please notify ARJ Software, Inc.


     Read/Write error <message> on drive <letter>

         Self-explanatory.

     
     Requires ARJ32 or -hy option

         The archive being processed was created by ARJ32 using the ANSI 
         codepage and may contain filenames that are not accessible via 
         DOS.  ARJ32 can process this type of archive.  ARJ for DOS may
         have problems.
         
         You can use the -hy option with ARJ for DOS to attempt extraction 
         of this archive.  However, some files may be created with 
         incorrect filenames.


     Requires Windows 95/98/NT or -hf1 or -hf2 option,

         An archive built under Windows 95 may not extract under a short 
         filename environment (DOS 6, plain DOS 7, Win95 MS-DOS mode) 
         UNLESS it was built with the -hf option or -hf1 option.

         The -hf1 and -hf2 option can be used to force ARJ to extract a
         Win95 ARJ archive.

         ARJ does NOT support the use of long filenames under Windows NT.


     Set label error

         ARJ could not set the volume label to the volume label stored in
         the archive.  This can happen if the volume label in the archive
         is not a standard DOS volume label.


     Signal failed

         This error should not happen.  Please report this problem.


     Skipping a possible ARJ-SECURED archive

         This message is displayed when the option (-he1) has been 
         specified and ARJ has just accessed an ARJ archive that has an 
         ARJ-SECURITY envelope on it.  This does NOT indicate the validity 
         or integrity of the ARJ-SECURITY envelope.


     Stream: <number> both CRC sections damaged. Can't verify file.

         The ARJ data damage protection data is damaged.  It is not
         possible to determine what sections of the archive are damaged.


     The ARJ-SECURITY envelope on this archive has been violated

         This ARJ archive has been damaged or corrupted.  The contents of
         the archive are not in the same condition as when it was created.


     This archive HAS a valid ARJ-SECURITY envelope

         This ARJ archive has been ARJ-SECURED and most probably is in the
         same condition as when it was created.


     Too much damage. Recovery aborted.

         ARJ cannot fix the damage to this archive.  There are too many
         errors to fix.


     Unknown file type: <number>

         ARJ has encountered an unknown file type in the archive.
         You may need a newer version of ARJ to process this archive.


     Unknown method: <number>

         ARJ has encountered an unknown compression method in the archive.
         You may need a newer version of ARJ to process this archive.


     Unknown version: <number>

         ARJ has encountered an unknown extraction version in the archive.
         You may need a newer version of ARJ to process this archive.


     User abort!

         The user entered a response to an ARJ query which resulted in
         termination of ARJ.


     *** Valid ARJ-SECURITY envelope signature:

         This message is displayed when ARJ has verified that the archive
         has a valid ARJ-SECURITY envelope.  This indicates that the
         archive contents are intact and unmodified as originally
         distributed by the individual identified in the text that follows
         this message.


     *** Verifying ARJ SECURITY envelope ...

         ARJ is testing the integrity of the ARJ-SECURITY envelope on the
         archive.  If the envelope has been corrupted or damaged, ARJ will
         display a message to that effect.


     Volume labels are not allowed for SFX

         The ARJ self-extraction modules, ARJSFXJR and ARJSFX, do not
         support the extraction of volume labels.


     Warning! Not a standard ARJ garble module: <filename>

         Either a non-standard encryption module has been specified or the
         standard ARJ encryption module has been damaged.

         This message will appear when using the ARJCRYPT.COM version 2.1
         module with ARJ 2.60.


     Warning! Only <number> bytes of free disk space. Continue?

         Self-explanatory.


     Wrong encryption version: <number>

         ARJ stores the encryption method in the ARJ main header.  It is
         improper to mix encryption methods in a single archive.  Specify
         the correct encryption method to use.  The old XOR version is
         designated as "0" or "1".  The GOST versions are labeled "2",
         "3", or "4".

         This error message may occur if you specify the -hg option when
         trying to garble ("g") an archive that uses a different
         encryption method or when trying to create an ARJSFX module. Only
         the ARJSFXV module supports the -hg encryption options.

         This error message may occur if you are "j"oining two archives
         that are using different encryption methods.
