/* PCRE keeps offsets in its compiled code as 2-byte quantities by default.
These are used, for example, to link from the start of a subpattern to its
alternatives and its end. The use of 2 bytes per offset limits the size of the
compiled regex to around 64K, which is big enough for almost everybody.
However, I received a request for an even bigger limit. For this reason, and
also to make the code easier to maintain, the storing and loading of offsets
from the byte string is now handled by the macros that are defined here.

The macros are controlled by the value of LINK_SIZE. This defaults to 2 in
the config.h file, but can be overridden by using -D on the command line. This
is automated on Unix systems via the "configure" command. */
