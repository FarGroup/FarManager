$^#Archive support plugin#
    This FAR module performs transparent #archive# processing.
Files in the archive are handled in the same manner as if they
were in a folder: when you operate with the archive, FAR
transforms your commands into the corresponding external
archiver calls.

@AddToArc
$ #Adding files to archive#
    In this dialog you may choose the archiver, add or change
command line switches (default switches may be defined using
the ~Archiver settings~@ArcSettings2@ dialog), enter a password
to encrypt files during archiving.

    The option #Delete files after archiving# forces the archiver
to move rather than copy files to the archive. This option is turned
on automatically if the key #F6# is used to add files to an archive.

    The option #Exact archive filename# allows to create archives with
nonstandard extensions (if this is supported by the archiver). If the
option is turned off, the extension defined in the
~Archiver command lines~@ArcSettings2@ dialog is appended to the name
entered in the dialog.

    The option #Background# starts the archiving process in a separate window.

    The #Priority of process# option allows to change the execution
~priority~@ArcPrior@ of the archiving process.

    Pressing the #Save settings# button saves the current archiver and
switches for future usage.

    Pressing the keys #Shift-F1# has the same effect as pushing the
"Select archiver" button and allows to select the archiver type to use.

    When a new archive is created, the cursor is automatically
positioned to the new archive once the archiving operation is
complete. (This is not done when the archiver is started in a
separate window.)

@ArcPrior
$ #Priority of process#
    MultiArc allows to control the execution priority
of the archiving process. The following priorities are available:

    #low#
    Background priority, foreknown to be lower than the priority of any
other process in the system. Archiving will be very slow if any other
process is active.

    #below normal#
    Priority above #low#, but below #normal#. Sets the priority of the
archiving process above the background tasks, but lower than the
execution priority of normal tasks (only in Windows 2000 or newer).

    #normal#
    Archiving is executed along with other tasks on the computer.

    #above normal#
    Priority above "normal", but below "high". Archiving is given higher
priority than all other normal processes, and can substantially slow
down their execution (only in Windows 2000 or newer).

    #high#
    Specify this priority for time-critical archiving that must be
executed without delay. ATTENTION: Use extreme care when using the high
priority, because a high priority application can use nearly all
available CPU time, while the gain from using this priority can only be
achieved when other active processes are running in the system.

    The "normal" priority is selected by default.

@ExtrFromArc
$ #Extracting files from archive#
    In this dialog you may enter the path to extract files and set the
password to decrypt archived files.

    Option #Extract without pathnames# forces extraction of all files
to the same folder.

    If the option #Delete from archive after extracting# is turned on,
the files will be deleted from the archive after they are extracted.
This option is turned on automatically if the key #F6# is used to extract
files from an archive.

    To immediately extract selected archived files to the current folder
you may also use #Alt-F6#.

@ArcCmd
$ #Archive commands#
    From this menu you can test archive, add an archive comment,
convert an archive to SelF-eXtracting (SFX), try to recover a
broken archive, protect an archive from damage or disable
archive modifications.

    Notes:

    1. To execute an archive management command you need to have
the corresponding archiver tool. Archiver options may be changed
in the ~Archiver settings~@ArcSettings2@ dialog.

    For quick access to archiver options, you can press the key
F4 in the "Archive commands" menu.

    2. The whole set of archive management commands may only be
used with RAR and ACE archives. Other archivers will support only
a sub-set of these commands.

@ArcSettings1
$ #Archive support configuration#
    In this dialog you may change following parameters:

 #The way of archivers#   Do not hide archiver output,
 #output displaying#      hide for view operation or hide always

 #Process Shift-F1#       Add files to archives on Shift-F1.
 #command#                You may wish to disable this option
                        if you have another archive support plugin
                        installed, which processes Shift-F1 command.

 #Change folder when#     If a new archive is created not in the
 #setting the cursor#     current folder, change the folder and
 #on new archive#         position the cursor on the archive.
                        If the option is off, the cursor will be
                        positioned on the archive only if it is
                        created in the current folder.

 #Use last command#       When adding files to archives, the last
 #from history#           used value of the archiver command line
                        switches will be placed in the "Switches"
                        edit line.

 #Automatically reset#    The option "Exact archive filename"
 #"Exact archive#         will be turned off every time the dialog
 #filename"#              "Add to archive" is invoked

 #Description list#       Names of files with ~descriptions~@:FileDiz@ of archived
 #names delimited#        files.
 #with commas#

 #Read archive#           Read descriptions of archived files
 #descriptions#           when entering to an archive. This enables
                        the viewing of descriptions but slows down
                        archive reading.

 #Update archive#         Update descriptions of archived files
 #descriptions#           after adding to or deleting from an archive.


@ArcSettings2
$ #Archiver command lines#
    In this dialog you may change external archiver command lines
for different archive processing operations, the ~mask~@:FileMasks@ that will
be used to select all files and the archive extension (it must not begin
with a dot).

    To reset all the settings of an archiver to the default values,
press the Reset button.

    The following variables may be used:

 #%%A# - Archive name.

 #%%a# - Short archive name.

 #%%W# - Temporary folder including the terminating slash.

 #%%P# - Password.

 #%%R# - Current archive folder.

 #%%L# - Filelist name. Filelist is the file containing names of files
       to be processed by the external archiver.

 #%%l# - Filelist with short file names.

 #%%F# - Names of one or more files to be processed. If all names
       cannot be placed in a single string, the archiver will be
       executed several times until all file names are exhausted.
       By default maximum total command length is 127, but you can
       specify it directly after %%F, for example %%F512.
       Variable %%F should be used only if the destination archiver
       does not support filelists.

 #%%f# - The name of a single file to process. The archiver will be
       executed several times until all file names are exhausted.
       This variable should be used only if the destination archiver
       does not support filelists or multiple file names on
       the command line.

 #%%E#<errorlevel> - maximum acceptable command errorlevel.
       For example, %%E2 indicates that errorlevels 0, 1 and 2
       are acceptable. This variable may be specified in any place
       of command. If it is absent, only errorlevel 0 is considered
       as successful.

 #%%S# - Place in the command line to insert additional switches,
       specified in the second string of "Add" dialog. If this
       variable is absent, switches are added to end of command
       line.

    Variable modifiers Q, q, S, M, N, *, W, P can be used to change
file names format details:

    'Q' - quote names with spaces;
    'q' - quote all names;
    'S' - use '/' instead of '\' in pathnames;
    'M' - transfer folder names to archiver as 'foldername\*.*';
    'N' - transfer folder names to archiver as 'foldername';
    '*' - use '*' mask to select all files. This modifier
          overrides "All files mask" parameter for single
          archiver command;
    'W' - use name only, without path;
    'P' - use path only, without name;
    'A' - use ANSI encoding.

    These modifiers may be specified immediately after %%F, %%f, %%L
or %%l variables without spaces. 'P' and 'A' also may be used with
%%A and %%a. Several modifiers are allowed, for example %%LMN or
%%F*QSN128 are valid. If neither 'M' nor 'N' modifier is specified,
'N' is assumed. If both 'M' and 'N' are specified, both 'foldername'
and 'foldername\*.*' will be transferred to archiver.

    If a part of the external archiver command string is enclosed
in {  } braces, it will be added to the resulting string only
if this part contains at least one non-empty variable
from those described above.

    If an external archiver does not support a particular command,
leave the corresponding string blank.

@ArcSettings3
$ #Storage of plugin settings#
    The plugin uses the following rules to load/save the settings of
supported format modules:

  1. #[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Far\Plugins\MultiArc\Type]#
     contains the settings common for all users. These settings can
     only be changed by editing the registry manually, for example,
     using *.reg files.

  2. Any changes to the archiver command line settings are stored to
     #[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Far\Plugins\MultiArc\Type]#.

  3. The plugin reads the archiver command line settings in the
     following sequence:

     a) [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Far\Plugins\MultiArc\Type]
     b) [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Far\Plugins\MultiArc\Type]
     c) settings provided by the FMT module.
