   - bug: плагин пытался докачать файл даже если сервер не поддерживает
          докачку. Теперь он пишет в CMD Window сообщение и начинает сначала.
   - bug: "Глубока и широка река из д..а и высоки ее берега..." (с)
          О чем это я?... А, о том, что велико и тоскливо разнообразие серверов
          и их реакций на одни и те же команды.
          Короче: на некоторых серверах плагин неправильно обрабатывал ответы
          на прерывание передачи файла.

          Symptoms:
            During transfer several files, cancel transfer - plugin switch to
            hosts mode or continue operation;
   - bug: plugin does not wait until server confirm ABORT command.
          Symptoms:

 [22.11.02]
   - bug: если нажать F5 и долго ничего не делать а потом отменить
          копирование, то плагин издает звук прекращения операции,
          хотя никакой операции не производилось;

 [21.11.02] rc1
   - bug: плагин падает при выходе из ФАРа, если ФАР его загрузил,
          но не вызвал ни одной плагиновой функции (после очистки
          кеша, к примеру);
   - bug: плагин неправильно обрабатывает некоторые ошибки сокетов
          при закачке файлов в результате, иногда, пытался закрывать
          соединение когда это не надо и не закрывал, когда это
          было нужно;
   - bug: плагин неправильно производит прерывание передачи данных
          при некоторых ошибках (наследие) от чего наблюдаются
          различные хаос эффекты. В частности ошибки предыдущего
          пункта могло и не быть...

 [12.11.02]
   - bug: нет ".." в панели фтп, если сервер эти точки не
          возвращает в листинге;
   - bug: в попытках починить ошибки 42х ряда отпало соединение в
          ситуации:
            |->USER ххх
            |<-331 Password required for ххх.
            |->PASS *hidden*
            |<-230 User ххх logged in.
            |->REST 0
            |<-502 REST command not implemented.
          плагин считал что соединиться не удалось.

 [11.11.02]
   - bug: В ситуации:
            Connect, Timeout -> Retry -> Connect, Timeout -> ESC
          плагин часто падал.
          Я не гарантирую то, что он не будет падать сейчас, но
          что-то я починил...
   - bug: в поле "IO Buff size" отрезается последняя цифра, если
          не заданы "K" или "M" модификаторы.
   - bug: плагин не узнает ошибку 421 (Too many users) и пытается
          молча прочитать содержимое каталога.
   - add: Авто конвертация хостов старого формата в новый имени
          "Alexander Lishansky".
   - chg: Суб-плагины имеют расширение FLL.
   - chg: Значение "IO Buff size" по умолчанию установлено в 800К.

 [08.11.02]
   - del: Быстрый поиск на панели хостов работать не будет.
          Для того, чтобы работало копирование хостов с одной панели
          на другую ФАР требует, чтобы имя файла, которое ему сообщают,
          совпадало с тем, которое получается в каталоге после
          копирования.
          В результате: либо работает поиск, либо можно создавать разные
          файлы для одинаковых хостов. Второе мне кажется важнее.
          Если кому надо - могу сделать течинфу.
   - bug: Отпал выход из плагина по ".."
   - bug: При редактировании каталога на панели хостов заголовок "Create
          the folder", теперь "Change the folder".
   - bug: Не сохраняется измененный цвет "Сообщения" и "Ожидания"

          [04.11.02] не работает перекодировка имен файлов.
   - bug: Плагин ругается на неправильную версию при копировании
          хоста из каталога на диске.
   - add: Если имя пользователя задано, а пароль нет, по плагин
          спрашивает пароль при соединении как если бы было
          установлено "Ask password every time"

 [07.11.02] Plugin changes a little so it a version 1.5 from now
   -  !!: plugin is in beta testing mode:
            - compiled using VC 6.0 with dynamic RTL turned ON;
            - compiled as debug version to create more detailed
              log files;
   - add: plugin uses ExcDump library to log assertion messages;
          Please go to:
            http://194.226.246.49/Users/JouriM/html/ExcDump.html

   - bug: пытается создавать в реестре ключи с именами вида
            Software\Far\Plugins\FTP\Hosts\\Item0\
          что приводит к созданию не читающихся в последующем ключей.
   - bug: не убирает конечные пробелы при обработке командной строки
   - bug: теперь имена папок на панели хостов сбрасывает в командную
          строку без префикса "ftp://"
   - add: если из соединения вышли по "..", то плагин позиционирует
          курсор на панели хостов на тот сайт из которого вышли
   - bug: теперь, при _возвращении_ в режим хостов, плагин всегда ставит курсор
          на тот хост откуда вышли и возвращает правильный номер режима колонок

 [13.09.02]
   - add: you can use 'M' and 'K' chars to specify size multiplier in
          buffer size IO

   - add: on AskOverwrite dialog cursor keys navigates up and down on dialog
          buttons
   - bug: plugin do not quotes urls contains spaces
   - add: new TechInfo N12 named "DoNotExpandErrors":
            If this value set to TRUE (nonzero) plugin will not show error in
            expanded CMD window.

 [03.09.02]
   - bug: отломал выполнение команд на фтп из командной строки
   - bug: мерзкая бага при закачке:
          льем два файла "1" и "2". Первый на фтп есть. Плагин спрашивает
          про первый "перезаписать...". Если отвечаем "resume all", то
          плагин начинает лить ВТОРОЙ с того места, где закончил заливать
          ПЕРВЫЙ.
          Т.е. если первый файл содержит "12", а второй "1234", то во втором
          получим "0034". Всем сорри... :(

             expanded command window style.
             The default value for this field gets from
             techinfo N27.

 [23.04.02]
   - bug: plugin uses '\' instead '/' then delete files after move

          while plugin receive list of files in current directory.
   - chg: plugin now process F5, F6, Shift+F5, Shift+F6 keys itself.
          - no more annoying additional dialogs.
          - you enter real FTP paths.
          - you can move files from one plugin panel to another in case
            the both panels on the same FTP site.
            !Warning: not all FTP server software correctly execute
                      move operation. F.e. WarFTP does not move files but
                      create a zero-length files with the same name on
                      target directory.
                      This is the server error, not plugin.
          - rename of file work correctly.
   - chg: once more try to increase upload speed.
          Still need to check !!
   - chg: plugin writes debug log inside CMD log, so you need to enable
          log file (TechInfo N8 and N9) to create valid log to report
          me an errors.

 [19.04.02]
   - bug: wrong filenames encoding then autodetect table selected in host
          options.
   - bug: wrong message then files IO errors occurred during up|download
          operations (f.e. disk full).
   - chg: plugin processed CD command itself.
          So you can correctly change FTP directory using CD command-line
          command to directories looking like MS-DOS paths (f.e. "C:").
   - add: plugin send to server any command given from command line.
          F.e. you can type "help" then plugin connected to server and
          can see commands supported by server.
          !! Warning: you can not successfully execute command need data
          connections (such as "LIST").
   - add: plugin remember last used hosts path and start there next time
          hosts panel shown.
   - bug: some "specific" old-style hosts files not understood by plugin
          and will be invisible on hosts panel.
   - chg: action "PluginColumnMode" techinfo rule changed to next logic:
            1. plugin remember last used hosts panel mode.
            2. then hosts panel open plugin looking for "PluginColumnMode"
               value.
            3. If value found and it inside bounds [0..9] plugin use it
               as panel mode.
            4. If value not found, or set outside possible mode bounds
               plugin sets last used panel mode.
   - bug: plugin exports hosts entries with plain password.
          Now export crypted.
          !! Warning: If you import "*.ftp" files created with old version
          of plugin you lost password.
          To solve this problem - do not delete old entries before update to
          new version. Leave it as is.
          Plugin correctly read it from registry.
          After this re-export it if you need.

 [28.03.02]
   - bug: copy files instead rename if plugin opened on both panels

   - bug: Plugin show CMD window in such silent operation as F3/F4
   - add: techinfo N22: customizable month names for use with localized FTP
          server software
   - bug: try to balance upload|download speed. upload speed must be the same

   - 1. added current path in plugin (showed in copy/move FAR dialog when
        plugin panel is destination)
     2. ShowUploadDialog option OFF by default (because of p.1)

   * version info changed: FileVersion is set to plugin version,

 [29.11.01]
   - bug: memory overrun in URL create function
   - bug: "Selecting one folder and one record. F8...But the folder is not
          deleted"
   - remove buggy FAR API functions GetDirList and GetPluginDirList, so:
       1. no annoying "Scanning..." message, when calculate directory sizes
          for up/download
       2. copy to/from hosts panel now can operate with subdirectories
       *. Scanning status is now shown at the bottom of CMD window

          fix

 [27.11.01]
   - bug: connect from host edit dialog does not refresh plugin panel
   - added ".." in hosts panel
   - digit delimiter set to user locale value by default (no value in registry
     or 0)
   ! bug: try to delete base plugin registry key if no one of
     host/directory/option exist
   - bug: if column titles are wrong, then not all columns are shown
   - sorting hosts by: host, user, description
     (e.g., if host name is equal, then compare user name, etc.)
   - draw a "Working..." string on "idle" position when data is being
     transferred (for indication that prev idle done)

 [27.11.01]
   - digit delimiter can be set to 0 to use current user locale delimiter
     ! Seems not working on my machine (returns delimiter with code A0h).
   - host save mechanism totally changed:
      - no more annoying situation, when entering host with the same title
        silently overwrites the one that has already been set.
      - no more stupid rule "one host with the same title"
      - all existing hosts will be automatically converted to new store format
        when you confirm to change it
      - beautified and corrected host entries export mechanism
      - ! FAR has a bug in one of API function, so export of directories with
        contents is temporary unavailable
      - ! exporting directory with description from plugin panel looses the
        description
   - two new panel columns for default panel mode: home path, user name
   - new field in host edit dialog: user name (has higher priority than user
     name entered in host title)
   - description can be associated with plugin directory (new dialog in
     directory creation dialog and possibility to edit description by pressing
     F4)
   - shortcut, cmd line, history processing fully corrected
   - procedure of generation filename is corrected (names dropped by Ctrl+F to
     command line and put to clipboard now contain FULL state of FTP name
     including user name and password, if any)
   - host edit dialog mechanism is changed: name and password has an additional
     edit lines in dialog. These lines have a higher priority than data entered
     directly in FTP title.
     After you enter an FTP title, if additional fields have no data, they
     will be automatically filled with data from host title.
     After this you can safely remove password and/or username from host title,
     because it is already filled in additional fields.
     ! Warning: because additional fields have higher priority than host title
     data, to change user name and/or password entered in host title you must
     change host title data, clear additional fields, confirm dialog changes.

 [26.11.01]
   - bug: delete files even if "item delete" dialog is cancelled
   - bug: do not restore screen under CMD log in some situations (final??)
