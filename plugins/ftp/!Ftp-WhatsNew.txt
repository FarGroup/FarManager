             techinfo N27.
           - "Buffer size" edit which allow set different size of
             IO buffer for every site.

 [23.04.02]
   - bug: plugin uses '\' instead '/' then delete files after move
          operation
   - add: if login fail plugin re ask name and password from user.
          See techinfo N26 for disable this.
   - bug: wrong error messages then errors occured in local disk IO.
   - bug: possible assertion message then cancel restoring connection
          while plugin receive list of files in current directory.
   - chg: plugin now process F5, F6, Shift+F5, Shift+F6 keys itself.
          - no more annoying additional dialogs.
          - you enter real FTP paths.
          - you can move files from one plugin panel to another in case
            the both panels on the same FTP site.
            !Warning: not all FTP server software correctly execute
                      move operation. F.e. WarFTP does not move files but
                      create a zero-length files with the same name on
                      target directory.
                      This is the server error, not plugin.
          - rename of file work correctly.
   - chg: once more try to increase upload speed.
          Still need to check !!
   - chg: plugin writes debug log inside CMD log, so you need to enable
          log file (TechInfo N8 and N9) to create valid log to report
          me an errors.

 [19.04.02]
   - bug: wrong filenames encoding then autodetect table selected in host
          options.
   - bug: wrong message then files IO errors occurred during up|download
          operations (f.e. disk full).
   - chg: plugin processed CD command itself.
          So you can correctly change FTP directory using CD command-line
          command to directories looking like MS-DOS paths (f.e. "C:").
   - add: plugin send to server any command given from command line.
          F.e. you can type "help" then plugin connected to server and
          can see commands supported by server.
          !! Warning: you can not successfully execute command need data
          connections (such as "LIST").
   - add: plugin remember last used hosts path and start there next time
          hosts panel shown.
   - bug: some "specific" old-style hosts files not understood by plugin
          and will be invisible on hosts panel.
   - chg: action "PluginColumnMode" techinfo rule changed to next logic:
            1. plugin remember last used hosts panel mode.
            2. then hosts panel open plugin looking for "PluginColumnMode"
               value.
            3. If value found and it inside bounds [0..9] plugin use it
               as panel mode.
            4. If value not found, or set outside possible mode bounds
               plugin sets last used panel mode.
   - bug: plugin exports hosts entries with plain password.
          Now export crypted.
          !! Warning: If you import "*.ftp" files created with old version
          of plugin you lost password.
          To solve this problem - do not delete old entries before update to
          new version. Leave it as is.
          Plugin correctly read it from registry.
          After this re-export it if you need.

 [28.03.02]
   - bug: copy files instead rename if plugin opened on both panels
   - bug: file rename fail silently
   - bug: file rename sometimes not work
   - bug: then switching to FTP plugin do not set panel mode was before plugin
          start (use hosts panel mode instead)

          lost and restored after select "restore"
   - add: techinfo N21: keep alive.
          Send PWD every set period of time to prevent connection close by
          server.
          ! Because of FAR API limitation works only then plugin panel visible
   - bug: Plugin show CMD window in such silent operation as F3/F4
   - add: techinfo N22: customizable month names for use with localized FTP
          server software
   - bug: try to balance upload|download speed. upload speed must be the same

     edit lines in dialog. These lines have a higher priority than data entered
     directly in FTP title.
     After you enter an FTP title, if additional fields have no data, they
     will be automatically filled with data from host title.
     After this you can safely remove password and/or username from host title,
     because it is already filled in additional fields.
     ! Warning: because additional fields have higher priority than host title
     data, to change user name and/or password entered in host title you must
     change host title data, clear additional fields, confirm dialog changes.
