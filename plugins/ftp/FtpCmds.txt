            FarFtp used FTP commands list
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plugin uses only commands described in table below.
Each command has a name in registry, default value and usage description for
command usage in plugin.

The base key, where plugin is looking for commands names is:
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far2\plugins\FTP

The default commands values can be found in the registry file "TechInfo.reg".

Command string may contain any characters up to 20 length.
Command string may contain not only the command itself but additional command
parameters too.
Plugin does not change or convert text of commands, so you must enter just as
it requested by server.
