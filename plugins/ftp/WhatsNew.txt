~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[!] New advanced options configurable through the Windows registry
    (see "TechInfoFTP.txt")

[!] A new feature "resume all", and a corresponding button in the
    overwrite dialog. (The button "resume" is shown only if the server
    supports resuming. The possibility of resuming is now shown in the
    information window.)

[!] Changed the mechanism for editing and using the data in host records.
    The username and password now have separate edit fields in the dialog,
    and the data entered in those fields takes precedence over the username
    and password specified in the host name string.

[!] Changed the mechanism for saving host records to the registry:
     - if a record with a duplicate host name is entered, it no longer
       silently overwrites the old record;
     - there is no limit on the number of records with the same host
       name;
     - all existing records will be automatically converted to the new
       format as soon as the user confirms the change (presses OK in the
       host parameters dialog)

     - exporting a folder with a description from the plugin panel
       to a file causes the description to be lost

[!] The plugin does not work in passive mode all the time.

    configurable (see TechInfoFTP.txt #5, #6)

    URL with all information about the file, including the username and
    the password.

[+] It is now possible to specify descriptions also for folders
    in the hosts panel. (There is a new field in the "Make folder" dialog,
    and it is disabled when a directory on the FTP server is created.)
    The description can be added or edited by pressing F4 on the folder
    name.

[+] Two new columns in the hosts list: path and username.

[+] Added display of the current and total bytes copied in the copy dialog
    (can be turned off by the rule TechInfoFTP.txt #18)

[*] All possible text messages have been moved from the plugin code
    to language files.

[*] Possibility to configure the digits separator in the copy dialog
    (see TechInfoFTP.txt#1, #2). If the separator is set to 0, its value
    is taken from the locale settings for the current user.

[*] The password text is never shown in the panel caption, log or the
    command window. It is replaced with the string "*hidden*".

[*] Changed the algorithm for sorting host records: now the records are
    compared by server name, then by user name, then by description, and
    so on (that is, if the server names are equal, the user names are
    compared, and so on).

[*] The entry ".." is now shown in the hosts panel.

[*] Changed the algorithm for displaying numbers when copying: the size
    of the copy dialog is now selected automatically based on the size
    of the largest number, and the maximum value that can be correctly
    displayed is 2^64.

[*] When counting the size of files to be copied, the message "Scanning..."
    is no longer shown.

[*] The status of the active scanning operation is now displayed in the
    lower part of the FTP command window.

    plugin in the FileVersion field and the version of FAR in the
    ProductVersion field.

[*] Numbers displaying the current CPS are abbreviated to Mbytes and Kbytes.

    screen (TechInfoFTP.txt#19)

    activated.

[*] All settings are saved to the registry when the configuration dialog
    is closed by pressing "Ok"

[*] A correct error message is shown if the socket library initialization
    fails.

    opened on the passive panel did not work.
