@PerfCounters
$ #Dane liczników wydajności#
   The following descriptions were taken from the system registry value
   #HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib\009\Help#

   #Process#

   The performance object consists of counters that monitor running
application program and system processes. All the threads in a process
share the same address space and have access to the same data.

   #Thread Count#

   The number of threads currently active in this process. An instruction
is the basic unit of execution in a processor, and a thread is the object
that executes instructions. Every running process has at least one thread.

   #Priority Base#

   The current base priority of this process. Threads within a process can
raise and lower their own base priority relative to the process' base
priority.

   #Elapsed Time#

   The total elapsed time this process has been running.

   #Process ID#

   The unique identifier of this process. ID Process numbers are reused, so
they only identify a process for the lifetime of that process.

   #Parent Process ID#

   The Process ID of the process that created the process. Note that the
creating process may have terminated since this process was created and so
this value may no longer identify a running process.

   #% Processor Time#

   The percentage of time that the processor is executing a non-Idle
thread. This counter was designed as a primary indicator of processor
activity. It is calculated by measuring the time that the processor spends
executing the thread of the Idle process in each sample interval, and
subtracting that value from 100%. (Each processor has an Idle thread which
consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). It can be viewed
as the percentage of the sample interval spent doing useful work. This
counter displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the
sample interval. It is calculated by monitoring the time the service was
inactive, and then subtracting that value from 100%.

   #Page Faults/sec#

   The overall rate faulted pages are handled by the processor. It is
measured in numbers of pages faulted per second. A page fault occurs when a
process requires code or data that is not in its working set (its space in
physical memory). This counter includes both hard faults (those that
require disk access) and soft faults (where the faulted page is found
elsewhere in physical memory). Most processors can handle large numbers of
soft faults without consequence. However, hard faults can cause significant
delays. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in
the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.

   #Pool Paged Bytes#

   The number of bytes in the paged pool, an area of system memory
(physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be
written to disk when they are not being used. Memory: Pool Paged Bytes is
calculated differently than Process: Pool Paged Bytes, so it might not
equal Process: Pool Paged Bytes: _Total. This counter displays the last
observed value only; it is not an average.

   #Pool Nonpaged Bytes#

   The number of bytes in the nonpaged pool, an area of system memory
(physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that cannot be
written to disk, but must remain in physical memory as long as they are
allocated. Memory: Pool Nonpaged Bytes is calculated differently than
Process: Pool Nonpaged Bytes, so it might not equal Process: Pool Nonpaged
Bytes: _Total. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is
not an average.

   #% User Time#

   The percentage of non-idle processor time spent in user mode. (User mode
is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment
subsystems, and integral subsystems. The alternative, privileged mode, is
designed for operating system components and allows direct access to
hardware and all memory. The operating system switches application threads
to privileged mode to access operating system services). This counter
displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.

   #% Privileged Time#

   The percentage of non-idle processor time spent in privileged mode.
(Privileged mode is a processing mode designed for operating system
components and hardware-manipulating drivers. It allows direct access to
hardware and all memory. The alternative, user mode, is a restricted
processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and
integral subsystems. The operating system switches application threads to
privileged mode to access operating system services). % Privileged Time
includes time servicing interrupts and DPCs. A high rate of privileged time
might be attributable to a large number of interrupts generated by a
failing device. This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage
of the sample time.

   #Virtual Bytes#

   The current size in bytes of the virtual address space the process is
using. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply
corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. Virtual space is
finite, and by using too much, the process can limit its ability to load
libraries.

   #Virtual Bytes Peak#

   The maximum number of bytes of virtual address space the process has
used at any one time. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily
imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. Virtual space
is however finite, and by using too much, the process might limit its
ability to load libraries.

   #Working Set#

   The current number of bytes in the Working Set of this process. The
Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in
the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are
left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use. When free
memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If
they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set
before they leave main memory.

   #Working Set Peak#

   The maximum number of bytes in the Working Set of this process at any
point in time. The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently
by the threads in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a
threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are
not in use. When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed
from Working Sets. If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back
into the Working Set before they leave main memory.

   #Page File Bytes#

   The current number of bytes this process has used in the paging file(s).
Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are
not contained in other files. Paging files are shared by all processes, and
lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating
memory.

   #Page File Bytes Peak#

   The maximum number of bytes this process has used in the paging file(s).
Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are
not contained in other files. Paging files are shared by all processes, and
lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating
memory.

   #Private Bytes#

   The current number of bytes this process has allocated that cannot be
shared with other processes.

   #Handle Count#

   The total number of handles currently open by this process. This number
is the sum of the handles currently open by each thread in this process.

   #IO Read Operations/sec#

   The rate the process is issuing read I/O operations. This counter counts
all I/O activity generated by the process to include file, network and
device I/O's.

   #IO Write Operations/sec#

   The rate the process is issuing write I/O operations. This counter
counts all I/O activity generated by the process to include file, network
and device I/O's.

   #IO Data Operations/sec#

   The rate the process is issuing read and write I/O operations. This
counter counts all I/O activity generated by the process to include file,
network and device I/O's.

   #IO Other Operations/sec#

   The rate the process is issuing I/O operations that are neither a read
or a write operation. An example of this type of operation would be a
control function. This counter counts all I/O activity generated by the
process to include file, network and device I/O's.

   #IO Read Bytes/sec#

   The rate the process is reading bytes from I/O operations. This counter
counts all I/O activity generated by the process to include file, network
and device I/O's.

   #IO Write Bytes/sec#

   The rate the process is writing bytes to I/O operations. This counter
counts all I/O activity generated by the process to include file, network
and device I/O's.

   #IO Data Bytes/sec#

   The rate the process is reading and writing bytes in I/O operations.
This counter counts all I/O activity generated by the process to include
file, network and device I/O's.

   #IO Other Bytes/sec#

   The rate the process is issuing bytes to I/O operations that don't
involve data such as control operations. This counter counts all I/O
activity generated by the process to include file, network and device
I/O's.


@Columns
$ #Specjalne typy kolumn#
   Several #standard# column types have a special meaning in the Process
List:

   #S (Wielkość)#

   Displays the sum of Working Set and Page File counters.

   #D/T (Data/Czas)#

   Displays the process start date/time. The modification, creation
and last access date/time are the same.

   In addition to the standard FAR column types, these #special# column
types can be used in this plugin:

   #Numeric columns:#

   #XP# - Priotytet
   #XI# - ID procesu
   #XC# - Creating (parent) process ID
   #XT# - Number of threads
   #XG# - GDI Objects (local only)
   #XU# - USER Objects (local only)
   #XB# - Bitness (32/64)
   #X0...X21[S][T]# - performance counters (see below).

   #Description columns:#

   #ZP# - Pełna ścieżka
   #ZW# - Window title
   #ZD# - Opis pliku
   #ZC# - Linia poleceń (tylko lokalna)

   #WARNING:# In each panel mode there may be only one description
            column ('Zx'). To view different kinds of descriptions,
            you have to switch between modes.

   The ~Performance Counters~@PerfCounters@ column numbers are described
below.

   For X0..X2 you can append #S# to show percent value.

   For X11 and X14..X21 you can append #S# to show per second value.

   For any counter, if the column is too narrow to show the full number or
if #F# modifier is specified, the value is calculated in K's (1024), M's (1024*1024) etc.
You can append #T# to the column type to use 1000 instead of 1024 as a divider.

                        F5, search by Alt-F7, etc. Some details
                        make the output file too messy, some are
                        extracted too slowly, so you may want
                        to disable them.

 #Environment#            Include the process's environment block.
                        Used for local only.

 #Module info#            Include the list of modules loaded by
                        this process.

 #Module versions#        Along with the list of modules, extract
 #and descriptions#       description and version of each module's
                        file. This is a slow operation, since each
                        module's file is opened to look up its
                        version information.

 #Performance data#       Output all performance data counters for
                        this process.

 #Handles#                List all handles opened by the process.
                        Warning: this uses undocumented features
                        and may not work properly. Used for local only.

   In this version, #panel modes# are not configured in this dialog. When
you press "OK" in the dialog, the configuration is saved with the current
(default) modes. Once it's saved, edit the registry keys
#HKCU\Software\Far\Plugins\Plist\ModeX\# to change the defaults. When you
open the plugin again, the changes will be taken.
