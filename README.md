### Far Manager — what is it?
Far Manager is a program for managing files and archives in Windows operating systems. Far Manager works in text mode and provides a simple and intuitive interface for performing most of the necessary actions:
* viewing files and directories;
* editing, copying and renaming files;
* and many other actions.

### Customize it
Far Manager has a multi-language, easily configurable interface. File system navigation is made easier through the use of color highlighting and sort groups.

### Your task — your way
The functionality of Far Manager is greatly extended by external DLL modules — plugins (made possible by a special set of interfaces — the [Plugins API](https://api.farmanager.com/)). For example: archive support, FTP client, temporary panel and network browser are all implemented as plugins included in the standard distribution of Far.
