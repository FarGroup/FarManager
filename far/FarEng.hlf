$ #How to use help#
    Help screens may have reference items on them that lead to another help
screen. You may use #Tab# and #Shift-Tab# keys to move the cursor from one
reference item to another, then press Enter to go to a help screen
describing that item. With the mouse, you may click a reference to go to the
help screen about that item.

    If text does not completely fit in the help window, a scroll bar is
displayed. In such case #cursor keys# can be used to scroll text.

    You may press #Alt-F1# or #BS# to go back to a previous help screen
and #Shift-F1# to view the help contents.

    Press #Shift-F2# for ~plugins~@Plugins@ help.

    #F5# switches help between window and fullscreen modes.

@About
$ #About FAR#
    FAR is a text mode file and archive manager for Windows 95/98/Me,
Windows NT and Windows 2000/XP. It supports #long file names# and provides
a wide set of file and folder operations.

    FAR is #shareware# software. You must ~register~@Register@ it to continue to
use after 40-days trial period.

    FAR does transparent #archive# processing. Files in the archive are
handled similarly as in a folder: when you operate with the archive, FAR
transforms your commands into the corresponding external archiver calls.

    FAR offers a number of service functions as well.

@Register

  Notes:

  1. If "Allow reverse sort modes" option in ~Panel settings~@PanelSettings@
     dialog is enabled, pressing the same sort key second time
     toggles the sort direction from ascending to descending
     and vice versa;

  2. Alt-Left and Alt-Right combinations, used to scroll long names
     and descriptions, work only with non-numpad Left and Right keys.
     This is due to the fact that when Alt is pressed, numpad cursor
     keys are used to enter characters via their decimal codes.

  3. The key combination #Ctrl-Alt-Ins# puts the following text into
     the clipboard:
     * for network drives - the network (UNC) name of the file
       object;
     * for local drives - the local name of the file taking into
       account ~symbolic links~@HardSymLink@.

  4. If #Alt-Shift-Ins# or #Ctrl-Alt-Ins# is pressed when the cursor
     is on the file "#..#", the name of the current folder is copied.

  Execute in the separate window                         #Shift-Enter#

    Pressing Shift-Enter on a directory invokes the
    Windows Explorer and shows the selected directory.
    To show a root directory in the Explorer, you
    should press Shift-Enter on the required drive
    in the ~drive selection menu~@DriveDlg@. Pressing Shift-Enter
    on "#..#" opens the current directory in the Explorer.

  Change to the root folder                                   #Ctrl-\#

  Change folder, enter an archive (also a SFX archive)     #Ctrl-PgDn#

  If the cursor points to a directory, pressing Ctrl-PgDn changes to that
directory. If the cursor points to a file, then, depending on the file type,
an ~associated command~@FileAssoc@ is executed or the archive is opened.

  Change to the parent folder                              #Ctrl-PgUp#

    If the option "~Use Ctrl-PgUp to change drive~@InterfSettings@" is
    enabled, pressing Ctrl-PgUp in the root directory switches to
    the network plugin or shows the ~drive selection menu~@DriveDlg@.

  Create shortcut to the current folder               #Ctrl-Shift-<N>#
  Use folder shortcut                                  #RightCtrl-<N>#

$ #Miscellaneous#
  Screen grabber                                             #Alt-Ins#

  Screen grabber allows to select and copy to the clipboard any screen area.
Use arrow keys or click the left mouse button to move the cursor. To select
text use Shift-arrow keys or drag the mouse while holding the left mouse
button. Enter, Ctrl-Ins, right mouse button or doubleclick copy selected text
to the clipboard, Ctrl- <Gray +> appends it to the clipboard contents,
Esc leaves the grabbing mode.

  Record a ~keyboard macro~@KeyMacro@                                   #Ctrl-<.>#

  History in dialog edit controls                 #Ctrl-Up, Ctrl-Down#

  In dialog edit control history you may use Enter to copy the current item
to the edit control and Ins to mark or unmark an item. Marked items are not pushed
out of history by new items, so you may mark frequently used strings so that
you will always have them in the history.

  Clear history in dialog edit controls                          #Del#

  Delete the current item in a dialog edit line history
  list (if it is not locked)                               #Shift-Del#

  Set the dialog focus to the default element                   #PgDn#

  Insert a file name under cursor to dialog              #Shift-Enter#

  Insert a file name from passive panel to dialog   #Ctrl-Shift-Enter#

  This key combination is valid for all edit controls except the command
line, including dialogs and the ~internal editor~@Editor@.

  Pressing #Ctrl-Enter# in dialogs executes the default action (pushes
the default button or does another similar thing).

  In dialogs, when the current control is a check box:

  - turn on (#[x]#)                                             #Gray +#
  - turn off (#[ ]#)                                            #Gray -#
  - change to undefined (#[?]#)                                 #Gray *#
    (for three-state checkboxes)

  Left clicking outside the dialog works the same as pressing Esc.

  Right clicking outside the dialog works the same as pressing Enter.

  Clicking the middle mouse button in the ~panels~@PanelCmd@ has the same
effect as pressing the Enter key with the same modifiers (Ctrl, Alt,
Shift). If the ~command line~@CmdLineCmd@ is not empty, its contents
will be executed. This behaviour can be configured in the ~settings~@InterfSettings@.

  Under Windows 2000/XP, FAR Manager supports the ~mouse wheel~@MsWheel@.

@MsWheel
$ #Mouse wheel support#
   Under Windows 2000/XP, FAR Manager supports the mouse wheel:

   #Panels#
     Rotating the wheel scrolls the file list without changing the
     cursor position on the screen. Pressing the middle button has
     the same effect as pressing Enter (this can be configured in the
     ~settings dialog~@InterfSettings@).

   #Editor#
     Rotating the wheel scrolls the text without changing the cursor
     position on the screen (similar to Ctrl-Up/Ctrl-Down).

   #Viewer, help#
     Rotating the wheel scrolls the text.

   #Menus#
     Wheel scrolling works as Up/Down buttons.
     Pressing the middle button has the same effect as pressing
     Enter. It is possible to choose items without moving the cursor.

   #Dialogs#
     In dialogs, when the wheel is rotated at an edit line with a
     history list or a combo box, the drop-down list is opened. In
     the drop-down list scrolling works the same as in menus.

   You can specify the number of lines to scroll at a time in the
panels, editor and viewer (see TechInfo##33).

@CmdLine
$ #Command line switches#
  The following switches may be used in the command line:

  #/a#    Disable display of characters with codes 0 - 31
        and 255.
        May be useful when executing FAR under telnet.

  #/ag#   Disable display of pseudographics characters.

  #/e[<line>[:<pos>]] <filename>#
        Edit the specified file. After /e you may optionally
        specify editor start line and line position.

        For example: far /e70:2 readme.

  #/i#    Set small (16x16) icon for FAR console window.
        In some configurations this switch may lead to
        unstable work.

  #/p[<path>]#
        Search for "common" plugins in the directory specified by
        <path>. If <path> not specified, "common" plugins will not
        be loaded. It is also possible to use environment
        variables in the "/p" command line switch.

        For example: far /p%SystemRoot%\Profiles\%USERNAME%\FAR

  #/u <username>#
        Allows to have separate settings for different users.

        For example: far /u guest

        FAR Manager will set the ~environment variable~@FAREnv@
        "FARUSER" to the value <username>.

  #/v <filename>#
        View the specified file. If <filename> is `#-#', data
        is read from the stdin. For example, "dir|far /v -"
        will view dir command output.

  #/co#
        Forces FAR to load plugins from the cache only.
        In this mode FAR loads faster, but new or updated plugins
        are not recognized. When "/co" command line parameter is
        used, "/p" is ignored. Using this parameter makes
        sense ONLY if the list of installed plugins is stable.
        After updating plugins it is necessary to load FAR without
        this parameter.
        If there is no plugins cache, no plugins will be loaded.

  #/x#
        Disable exception handling. This option has been designed
        for plugin developers, and it is not recommended to specify
        it during normal operation.

  FAR <filename> command starts FAR and forces it to show <filename>
contents if it is an archive or show folder contents if <filename>
is a folder.

@Plugins
$ #Plugins support#
    External DLL modules (plugins) may be used to implement new FAR commands
and emulate file systems. For example, archives support, FTP client,
temporary panel and network browser are plugins that emulate file systems.

    All plugins are stored in separate folders within the 'Plugins' folder,
which is in the same folder as FAR.EXE. When detecting a new plugin FAR
saves information about it and later loads the plugin only when necessary,
so unused plugins do not require additional memory. But if you are sure that
some plugins are useless for you, you may remove them to save disk space.

    Plugins may be called either from ~Change drive menu~@DriveDlg@ or from
#Plugin commands# menu, activated by #F11# or by corresponding item of
~Commands menu~@CmdMenu@. #F4# in "Plugin commands" menu allows to assign
hot keys to menu items (this makes easier to call them from
~keyboard macros~@KeyMacro@). This menu is accessible from file panels
and (only by F11) from the internal viewer and editor. Only specially
designed plugins will be shown when calling the menu from the viewer and
editor.

    You may set plugin parameters using ~Plugin configuration~@PluginsConfig@
command from ~Options menu~@OptMenu@.

    File processing operations like copy, move, delete, edit or ~Find
file~@FindFile@ work with plugins, which emulate file systems, if these
plugins provide necessary functionality. Search from the current folder
in the "Find file" command requires less functionality than search from the
root folder, so try to use it if search from the root folder does not work
correctly.

    The modules have their own message and help files. You can get a
list of available help on the modules by pressing

    #Shift-F2# - anywhere in the FAR help system

    #Shift-F1# - in the list of plugins (context-dependent help).

    If the plugin has no help file, then context-dependent help will
not pop out.

    If the active panel shows a plugin emulated file system, the command
"CD" in the command line may be used to change the plugin file system
folder. Unlike "CD", "CHDIR" command always treats the specified parameter as
a real folder name regardless a file panel type.

@PluginsConfig
$ #Plugins configuration#
    You can configure the installed ~plugin modules~@Plugins@ using
the command #"Plugins configuration"# from the ~Options menu~@OptMenu@.

    To get the help on the currently selected plugin, press #Shift-F1#
- context-sensitive help on plugin configuration. If the plugin
doesn't have a help file, the context-sensitive help will not be
shown.

    When the context-sensitive help is invoked, FAR will try to show
the topic #Config#. If such a topic does not exist in the plugin help
file, the main help topic for the selected plugin will be shown.

    Pressing #F4# in the #"Plugins configuration"# menu allows to
assign hotkeys for the items of that menu, allowing to invoke them
later through ~keyboard macro commands~@KeyMacro@.


@PluginsReviews
$ #Overview of plugin capabilites#
    The FAR manager is so tightly integrated with its plugins that it
is simply meaningless to talk about FAR and not to mention the plugins.
Plugins present an almost limitless expansion of the features of FAR.

    Without going into details, some of the capabililities can be noted:

  * Syntax highlighting in program source texts.
  * Working with FTP-servers (including access through proxy).
  * Search and replace in many files at the same time, using regular
    expressions.
  * Renaming groups of files with support for complex compound masks
    consisting of substitution symbols and templates.
  * NNTP/SMTP/POP3/IMAP4 clients and sending messages to a pager.
  * Working with non-standard text screen resolutions.
  * Conversion of texts from one national code page to another.
  * Manipulating the contents of the Recycle Bin.
  * Process priority control on local or network PC.
  * Words autocomplete in editor and working with templates.
  * Windows system registry editing.
  * Creating and modifying Windows shortcuts.
  * File and text operations making it more comfortable to use FidoNet.
  * Files UU-encode and UU-decode.
  * WinAmp control and MP3-tags modifying.
  * Quake PAK-files processing.
  * Printers control, both connected to PC and network.
  * Connection and debugging of queries to ODBC-compatible
    databases.
  * RAS service control.
  * External programs executing (compilers, convertors etc.) while
    editing text in FAR editor.
  * Windows help files contents displaying (.hlp and .chm)
  * Calculators with different possibilities.
  * Several games :-)
  * Spell checker functions while editing text in FAR editor.
  * Removable drives catalog preparation and much more...

@Panels
$ #Panels#
    Normally FAR shows two panels (left and right windows), with different
information. If you want to change the type of information displayed in the
panel, use the ~panel menu~@LeftRightMenu@ or corresponding ~keyboard commands~@KeyRef@.

    See also the following topics to obtain more information:

      ~File panel~@FilePanel@                 ~Tree panel~@TreePanel@
      ~Info panel~@InfoPanel@                 ~Quick view panel~@QViewPanel@

      ~Drag and drop files~@DragAndDrop@
      ~Selecting files~@SelectFiles@
      ~Customizing file panel view modes~@PanelViewModes@

@FilePanel
$ #File panel#
    The file panel displays the current folder.
You may select or deselect files and folders, perform different file
and archive operations. Read ~Keyboard reference~@KeyRef@ for commands list.

    Default view modes of the file panel are:

 #Brief#         File names are displayed within three columns.

 #Medium#        File names are displayed within two columns.

 #Full#          Name, size, date and time of the file are displayed.

 #Wide#          File names and sizes are displayed.

 #Detailed#      File names, sizes, packed sizes, last modification,
               creation, access time and attributes are displayed.
               Fullscreen mode.

 #Descriptions#  File names and ~file descriptions~@FileDiz@

 #Long#          File names, sizes and descriptions.
 #descriptions#  Fullscreen mode.

 #File owners#   File names, sizes and owners.

 #File links#    File names, sizes and hard links number.

 #Alternative#   File name, size (formatted with commas) and date
 #full#          of the file are displayed.

    You may ~customize file panel view modes~@PanelViewModes@.

    Packed sizes are valid for NTFS compressed files or files inside an
archive. File owners and hard links number have meaning for NTFS only. Some
file systems may not support file creation and access dates.

    If you wish to change the panel view mode, choose it from
the ~panel menu~@LeftRightMenu@. After the mode change or drive change
action, if the initial panel type differs it will be automatically
set to the file panel.

    #Speed search# action may be used to point to the required file by the
first letters of its name. Hold the Alt key and type the file name until
the required file is selected. Pressing #Ctrl-Enter# keys simultaneously will
point to the next match if one exists.  Wildcards '*' and '?' may be used
freely.

@TreePanel
$ #Tree panel#
    The tree panel displays the folder structure of the current disk as a tree.
Within tree mode you may change to a folder quickly and perform folder
operations.

    FAR stores folder tree information in the file named #Tree.Far# at root
folder of each drive. For read-only drives this information is stored in the
hidden folder Tree.Cache within the folder containing FAR.EXE.

    You can find a folder quickly with the help of #speed search# action.
Hold the Alt key and type the folder name until you point to the right
folder. Pressing #Ctrl-Enter# keys simultaneously will select the next match.

@InfoPanel
$ #Info panel#
    The information panel contains the following data:

 - #network# names of the computer and the current user;

 - name and type of the #current disk#, type of the file system, network
name, total and free space, disk volume label and serial number;

 - #memory# load percentage (100% means all of available memory is used),
total and free size of the physical and virtual memory;

 - #folder description# file

    You may view the contents of the folder description file in full screen
by pressing the #F3# key or clicking the left mouse button. To edit or
create the description file, press #F4# or click the right mouse button.
You can also use many of the ~viewer commands~@Viewer@ (search, code page
selection and so on) for viewing the folder description file.

    A list of possible folder description file names may be defined
using "Folder description files" command in the ~Options menu~@OptMenu@.

@QViewPanel
$ #Quick view panel#
    The quick view panel is used to show information about the selected item
in  the ~file panel~@FilePanel@ or ~tree panel~@TreePanel@.

    If the selected item is a file then the contents of the file is displayed.
For files of registered Windows types the type is shown as well.

    For folders, the quick view panel displays total size, total compressed
size, number of files and subfolders in the folder, current disk cluster size,
real files size, including files slack (sum of the unused cluster parts).
Compressed size has meaning for NTFS drives only.

    In Windows 2000/XP, when viewing reparse points, the path to the source folder
is also displayed.

@DragAndDrop
$ #Drag and drop files#
    It is possible to perform #Copy# and #Move# file operations using
#drag and drop#. Press left mouse button on the source file or folder,
drag it to the another panel and release the mouse button.

    If you wish to process a group of files or folders, select them before
dragging, click the left mouse button on the source panel and drag the files
group to the other panel.

    You may switch between copy and move operations by pressing the right mouse
button while dragging. Also to move files you can hold the #Shift# key while
pressing the left mouse button.

@Menus
$ #Menus#
    To choose an action from the menu you may press F9 or click on top
of the screen.

    When the menu is activated by pressing #F9#, the menu for the active
panel is selected automatically. When the menu is active, pressing #Tab#
switches between the menus for the left and right panel. If the menus "Files",
"Commands" or "Options" are active, pressing #Tab# switches to the menu of
the passive panel.

    Use the Shift-F10 key combination to select the last used menu command.

    Read the following topics for information about a particular menu:

     ~Left and right menus~@LeftRightMenu@          ~Files menu~@FilesMenu@

     ~Commands menu~@CmdMenu@                 ~Options menu~@OptMenu@

@LeftRightMenu
$ #Left and right menus#
    The #Left# and #Right# menus allow to change left and right panel
settings respectively. These menus include the following items:

   #Brief#                Display files within three columns.

   #Medium#               Display files within two columns.

   #Full#                 Display file name, size, date and time.

@ConfirmDlg
$ #Confirmations#
    In the #Confirmations# dialog you can switch on or off confirmations
for following operations:

    - overwrite destination files when performing file copying;

    - overwrite destination files when performing file moving;

    - ~drag and drop~@DragAndDrop@ files;

    - delete files;

    - delete folders;

    - interrupt operation;

    - ~disconnect network drives~@DisconnectDrive@ from the Disks menu;

    - ~reloading~@EditorReload@ a file in the editor;

    - clearing the view/edit, folder and command history lists;

    - exit from FAR.


@MakeFolder
$ #Make folder#
    This function allows you to create folders. You can use environment
variables in the input line, which are expanded to their values before creating
the folder. Also you can create multiple nested subfolders at the same time:
simply separate the folder names with the backslash character. For example:

    #%USERDOMAIN%\%USERNAME%\Folder3#

    If the option "#Process multiple names#" is enabled, it is possible to
create multiple folders in a single operation. In this case, folder names
should be separated with the character "#;#" or "#,#". If the option is
enabled and the name of the folder contains a character "#;#" (or "#,#"),
it must be enclosed in quotes. For example, if the user enters
#C:\Foo1;"E:\foo,2;";D:\foo3#, folders called "#C:\Foo1#", "#E:\foo,2#"
and "#D:\foo3#" will be created.

@FindFile
$ #Find file#
    This command allows to locate in the folder tree one or more
files and folders matching one or more ~wildcards~@FileMasks@ (delimited
with commas). It may also be used with file systems emulated
by ~plugins~@Plugins@.

    Optional text string may be specified to find only files containing
this text. If the string is entered, the option #"Case sensitive"# selects case
sensitive comparison.

    The option #"Whole words"# will let to find only the text that
is separated from other text with spaces, tab characters, line breaks or
standard separators, which by default are: #!%^&*()+|{}:"<>?`-=\[];',./#.

    The #"Using character table"# pull down list allows to select the concrete
character table for the text search or forces usage of all character tables
available to FAR by selecting #All character tables# item to search text in files
with different codepages.

    If the option #"Search in archives"# is set, FAR also performs the search in
archives with known formats. However, using this option significantly
decreases the performance of the search. FAR cannot search in nested archives.

    The #"Search for folders"# option includes in search list those folders,
that match the wildcards. Also the counter of found files takes account of
found folders.

    Search may be performed in all non-removable disks, in all folders
from the disk root, from the current folder, in the current folder only
or in selected folders. The search origin is saved in the configuration.

    While search is in progress or when it is finished, you may use
the cursor keys to scroll the files list and the buttons to perform
required actions.

    During or after search the following buttons are available:

   #New search#      Start new search session.

   #Go to#           Breaks current search, changes panel folder
                   and moves cursor to the selected file.

   #View#            View selected file. If search is not completed,
                   it will continue in the background while the file
                   is viewed.

   #Panel#           Create a temporary panel and fill it with the
                   results of the last file search.

   #Stop#            Break current search. Available while search
                   is in progress.

   #Cancel#          Close the search dialog.

    F3 and F4 may be used to view and edit found files. Also
viewing and editing is supported for plugin emulated file systems.
Note, that saving editor changes by F2 key in emulated file system
will perform #SaveAs# operation, instead of common #Save#.

@FindFolder
$ #Find folder#
    This command allows a quick look for the required folder in
the folders tree.

    To select a folder you may use the cursor keys or type first
characters of the folder.

    Press #Enter# to switch to the selected folder.

    #Ctrl-R# and #F2# force the rescan of the folders tree.

@History
$ #History#
    The commands history shows the list of previously executed
commands. Besides the cursor control keys, the following keyboard
shortcuts are available:

  Execute a previously executed command                         #Enter#

  Execute a previously executed command in a new window   #Shift-Enter#

  Copy a command to the command line                       #Ctrl-Enter#

  Clear the commands history                                      #Del#

  Copy the text of the current command to the clipboard        #Ctrl-C#
  without closing the list                                or #Ctrl-Ins#

    To go to the previous or next command directly from the command
line, you can press #Ctrl-E# or #Ctrl-X# respectively.

    For choosing a command, besides the cursor control keys and Enter,
you can use the highlighted shortcut letters.

    If you want to save the commands history after exiting FAR, use
the respective option in the ~system settings dialog~@SystemSettings@.

  Remarks:

  1. Under Windows 9x/Me, long commands are truncated to 511 bytes
     before they are stored in the history.

@HistoryViews
$ #File view and edit history#
    The file view history shows the list of files that have been
recently viewed or edited. Besides the cursor control keys, the following
keyboard shortcuts are available:

  Reopen a file for viewing or editing                          #Enter#

  Copy the file name to the command line                   #Ctrl-Enter#

  Clear the history list                                          #Del#

  Copy the text of the current history item to the             #Ctrl-C#
  clipboard without closing the list                      or #Ctrl-Ins#

    For choosing a history item, besides the cursor control keys and Enter,
you can use the highlighted shortcut letters.

    Items of the view and edit history are moved to the end of the list
after they are selected. You can use #Shift-Enter# to select an item
without changing its position.

    If you want to save the view and edit history after exiting FAR, use
the respective option in the ~system settings dialog~@SystemSettings@.

  Remarks:

  Remarks:

  1. Under Windows 9x/Me, long file paths are truncated to 511 bytes
     before they are stored in the history.

@TaskList
$ #Task list#
    The task list displays active tasks. Each line of the list
contains a task window title.

    From the task list you may switch to the task window,
or kill the task with the Del key. Be careful when killing a task.
It stops the task immediately, and any unsaved information will be lost,
so it should be used only when really necessary, for example
to interrupt a program which does not respond.

    The task list may be called either from ~Commands menu~@CmdMenu@ or
using #Ctrl-W#. The keyboard shortcut Ctrl-W can also be used in the
viewer or the editor.

@CompFolders
$ #Compare folders#
    The compare folders command is applicable only when two
~file panels~@FilePanel@ are displayed. It compares the contents
of folders displayed in the two panels. Files existing in one panel only,
or those which have a date more recent than files with the same name
in the other panel, become marked.

    Subfolders are not compared. Files are compared only by name,
size and time, and file contents have no effect on the operation.


@UserMenu
$ #User menu#
    The user menu exists to facilitate calls of frequently used
operations. It contains a number of user defined commands and command
sequences, which may be executed when invoking the user menu. The menu
may contain submenus. ~Special symbols~@MetaSymbols@ are supported
both in the commands and in the command titles. Note, that
!?<title>?<init>! symbol may be used to enter additional parameters
directly before executing commands.

    With the #Edit user menu# command from the ~Commands menu~@CmdMenu@,
you may edit or create main or local user menu. There may only be one main
user menu. The main user menu is called if no local menu for the current
folder is available.  The local menu may be placed in any folder. You may
switch between the main menu and the user menu by pressing Shift-F2. Also
you may call the user menu of the parent folder by pressing BkSpace.

    You may add command separators to the user menu. To do this, you should
add a new menu command, define "-" as "hot key" and leave field "Label" empty.
To delete a menu separator, you must switch to file mode with Alt-F4 key.

    To execute a user menu command, select it with cursor keys and press Enter.
You may also press the hot key assigned to the required menu item.

    You may delete a submenu or menu item with the Del key, insert new
submenu or menu item with the Ins key or edit an existing submenu or menu
item with the F4 key. Press Alt-F4 to edit the menu in text file form.

    It is possible to use digits, letters and function keys (F1..F12)
as hot keys in user menu. If F1 or F4 is used, its original function
in user menu is overridden. However, you still may use Shift-F4 to edit
the menu.

    When you edit or create a menu item, you should enter the hot key
for fast item access, the item title which will be displayed in the
menu and the command sequence to execute when this item will be selected.

    When you edit or create a submenu, you should enter the hot key and
the item title only.

    Local user menus are stored in the text files #FarMenu.Ini#.
The main menu, by default, is stored in the registry, but it is possible
to store it in a file. If you create a local menu in the FAR folder,
it will be used instead of the main menu saved in the registry.

@FileAssoc
$ #File associations#
    FAR Manager supports file associations, that allow to associate
various actions to running, viewing and editing files with a specified
~mask~@FileMasks@.

    You may add new associations with the #Edit associations# command
in the ~Commands menu~@CmdMenu@.

    You may define several associations for one file type and select
the desired association from the menu.

    The following actions are available in the associations list:

    #Ins#        - ~add~@FileAssocModify@ a new association

    #F4#         - ~edit~@FileAssocModify@ the current association

    #Del#        - delete the current association

    If no execute command is associated with file and
#Use Windows registered types# option in ~System settings~@SystemSettings@
is on, FAR tries to use Windows association to execute this file type;

@FileAssocModify
$ #Editing file associations#
    FAR allows to specify six commands associated with each file type
specified as a ~mask~@FileMasks@:

   #Execute command#               Performed if Enter is pressed
   #(used for Enter)#

   #Execute command#               Performed if Ctrl-PgDn is pressed
   #(used for Ctrl-PgDn)#

   #View command#                  Performed if F3 is pressed
   #(used for F3)#

   #View command#                  Performed if Alt-F3 is pressed
   #(used for Alt-F3)#

   #Edit command#                  Performed if F4 is pressed
   #(used for F4)#

   #Edit command#                  Performed if Alt-F4 is pressed
   #(used for Alt-F4)#

    The association can be described in the #Description of the association#
field.

    If you do not wish to switch panels off before executing
the associated program, start its command line with '#@@#' character.

    The following ~special symbols~@MetaSymbols@ may be used in the
associated command.

  Notes:

  1. If no execute command is associated with file and
#Use Windows registered types# option in ~System settings~@SystemSettings@
is on, FAR tries to use Windows association to execute this file type;

  2. Operating system ~commands~@OSCommands@ "IF EXIST" and "IF DEFINED"
allow to configure "smarter" associations - if you have specified several
associations for a file type, the menu will show only the associations
for which the conditions are true.

@MetaSymbols
$ #Special symbols#
    The following special symbols can be used in ~associated commands~@FileAssoc@,
~user menu~@UserMenu@ and the command ~"Apply command"~@ApplyCmd@:

    #!!#       '!' character
    #!#        Long file name without extension
    #!~~#       Short file name without extension
    #!`#       Long extension without file name (ext)
    #!`~~#      Short extension without file name (ext)
    #!.!#      Long file name with extension
    #!-!#      Short file name with extension
    #!+!#      Similar to !-! but if a long file name was lost
             after performing the command, FAR will restore it
    #!@@!#      Name of file with selected file names list
    #!$!#      Name of file with selected short file names list
    #!&#       List of selected files
    #!&~~#      List of selected short file names
    #!:#       Current drive
    #!\#       Current path
    #!/#       Short name of the current path

    #!?<title>?<init>!#
             This symbol is replaced by user input, when
             executing command. <title> and <init> - title
             and initial text of edit control.

             Several such symbols are allowed in the same line,
             for example:

             grep !?Search for:?! !?In:?*.*!|c:\far\far.exe -v -

    #!###       "!##" modifier specified before a file association
             symbol forces it to refer to the passive panel. For
             example, !##!.! denotes the name of the current file
             on the passive panel.

    #!^#       "!^" modifier specified before a file association
             symbol forces it to refer to the active panel. For
             example, !^!.! denotes a current file name on the
             active panel, !##!\!^!.! - a file on the passive
             panel with the same name as the name of the current
             file on the active panel.

  Notes:

   1. When handling special characters, FAR substitutes only the string
corresponding to the special character. No additional characters (for
example, quotes) are added, and you should add them yourself if it is
needed. For example, if a program used in the associations requires
a file name to be enclosed in quptes, you should specify #program.exe "!.!"#
and not #program.exe !.!#.

   2. The following modifiers may be used with the associations !@@! and !$! :

     'Q' - enclose names containing spaces in quotes;
     'S' - use '/' instead of '\' in pathnames;
     'F' - use full pathnames;
     'A' - use ANSI encoding.

   For example, the association #!@@AFQ!# means "name of file with the
list of selected file names, in ANSI encoding, include full pathnames,
names with spaces will be in quotes".

   3. When there are multiple associations specified, the meta-characters
!@@! and !$! are shown in the menu as is. Those characters are translated
when the command is executed.

   4. The prefixes "!##" and "!^" work as toggles for associations. The
effect of these prefixes continues up to the next similar prefix. For
example:

    if exist !##!\!^!.! diff -c -p !##!\!^!.! !\!.!

  "If the same file exists on the passive panel as the file under
   the cursor on the active panel, show the differences between
   the file on the passive panel and the file on the active panel,
   regardless of the name of the current file on the passive panel"

                          The operation of deleting to the Recycle
                          Bin can be performed only for local hard
                          disks.

  #Use system copy#         Use Windows function CopyFileEx
  #routine#                 (or CopyFile if CopyFileEx not available)
                          instead of internal copy implementation
                          to copy files. It may be useful on NTFS,
                          because CopyFileEx performs a more rational
                          disk space allocation and copies file
                          extended attributes.

  #Copy files opened#       Allows to copy files, which are opened
  #for writing#             by other programs for writing. This mode
                          is handy to copy a file opened for a long
                          time, but it could be dangerous, if a file
                          is being modified at the same time as
                          copying.

  #Create folders#          If the name of a new folder contains only
  #in uppercase#            lowercase letters and this option is on,

  #Inactivity time#         Terminate FAR after a specified interval
                          without keyboard or mouse activity. This
                          works only if FAR waits for command line
                          input without viewer or editor screens
                          in the background.

    Since this function requires some time to gather statistics,
    it is likely that you won't see any information if you're
    copying many small files and the option "Show total copy
    progress indicator" is disabled.

                          to autocomplete a line. The autocomplete
                          feature is disabled while a macro is
                          being recorded or executed.

    Notes:

    1. Custom character tables are provided in "Addons\Tables"
       subfolder of FAR folder in the form of .reg files.
       Before any table may be used, it must be installed: just press
       Shift-Enter on the corresponding file.

    2. Also to call search dialog you may just start typing the text
       to be located.

@ViewerGotoPos
$ #Go to specified position
  This dialog allows to change the position in the internal viewer.

  You can enter decimal offset, percent, or hexadecimal offset. The meaning
of the value you enter is defined either by the radio buttons in the dialog
or by format specifiers added before or after the value.

  You can also enter relative values, just add + or - before the number.

  Hexadecimal offsets must be specified in one of the following formats:
     0xNNNN, NNNNh, $NNNN

  Decimal offsets (not percentages) must be specified in the format NNNNd.

  Examples
   #50%#                     Go to middle of file (50%)
   #-10%#                    Go to 10% percent back from current offset
                           If the old position was 50%, the new
                           position will be 40%
   #0x100#                   Go to offset 0x100 (256)
   #+0x300#                  Go 0x300 (768) bytes forward

  If you enter the value with one of the format specifiers (%, '0x', 'h',
'$', 'd'), the radio buttons selected in the dialog will be ignored.

      The following options are available in that mode:

        #Case sensitive#      - the case of the characters
                              entered will be taken into account
                              while searching (so, for example,
                              #Text# will not be found when
                              searching for #text#).

        #Whole words#         - the given text will be found only
                              if it occurs in the text as a whole
                              word.

    Notes:

    1. Custom character tables are provided in the "Addons\Tables"
       subfolder of the FAR folder in the form of .reg files.
       Before any table may be used it must be installed: just press
       Shift-Enter on the corresponding file.

    2. #Alt-U#/#Alt-I# indent the current line if no block is selected.

@FileSaveAs
$ #Save file as...#
    You can save the file being edited under a different name by
pressing #Shift-F2# and specifying the new name.

    You can also specify the format of the line break characters:

    #Do not change#
    Do not change the line break characters.

    #Dos/Windows format (CR LF)#
    Line breaks will be represented as a two-character sequence -
    Carriage Return and Line Feed (CR LF), as used in DOS/Windows.

    #Unix format (LF)#
    Line breaks will be represented as a single character - Line
    Feed (LF), as used in UNIX.

@EditorGotoPos
$ #Go to specified line and column#
 This dialog allows to change the position in the internal editor.

 You can enter a #row# or a #column#, or both.

 The first number will be interpreted as a row number, the second as
a column number. Numbers must be delimited by one of the following
characters: "," "." ";" ":" or space.

 If you enter the value in the form ",Col", the editor will jump to
the specified column in the current line.

 If you enter the row with "%" at the end, the editor will jump
to the specified percent of the file. For example, if you enter #50%#,
the editor will jump to the middle of the text.

@EditorReload
$ #Reloading a file in the editor#
    FAR Manager tracks all attempts to repeatedly open for editing a
file that is already being edited. The rules for reloading files are
as follows:

    1. If the file was not changed and the option "Reload edited file"
in the ~confirmations~@ConfirmDlg@ dialog is not enabled, FAR switches
to the open editor instance without further prompts.

    2. If the file was changed or the option "Reload edited file" is
enabled, there are three possible options:

    #Current#      - Continue editing the same file

    #New instance# - The file will be opened for editing in a new
                   editor instance. In this case, be attentive: the
                   contents of the file on the disk will correspond
                   to the contents of the editor instance where the
                   file was last saved.

    #Reload#       - The current changes are not saved and the
                   contents of the file on the disk is reloaded into
                   the editor.

@WarnEditorPath
$ #Warning: Path to the file to edit does not exist#
    When opening a new file for ~editing~@Editor@, you have entered
the name of a folder that does not exist. Before saving the file, FAR
will create the folder, provided that the path is correct (for
example, a path starting with a non-existing drive letter would not be
correct) and that you have enough rights to create the folder.


@DriveDlg
$ #Change drive#
    This menu allows to change the current drive of a panel,
disconnect from a network drive or open a new ~plugin~@Plugins@ panel.

    Select the item with the corresponding drive letter to change the
drive or the item with the plugin name to create a new plugin panel.
If the panel type is not a ~file panel~@FilePanel@, it will be changed
to the file panel.

    #Del# key can be used:

     - to ~disconnect~@DisconnectDrive@ from network drives.

     - to delete a substituted (virtual) drive.

     - to eject disks from CD-ROM and removable drives.
       Under Windows 2000/NT/XP, ejecting a disk from a ZIP-drive
       requires administrative privileges.
       A CD-ROM can be closed by pressing #Ins#.


    #Ctrl-1# - #Ctrl-8# switch the display of different information:

    Ctrl-1 - disk type;
    Ctrl-2 - network name
             (and the path associated with a SUBST drive under NT);
    Ctrl-3 - disk label;
    Ctrl-4 - file system;
    Ctrl-5 - total and free disk size;
    Ctrl-6 - display of removable disk parameters;
    Ctrl-7 - display of plugin items;
    Ctrl-8 - display of CD parameters.

    #Change drive# menu settings are saved in the FAR configuration.

    If the option "~Use Ctrl-PgUp to change drive"~@InterfSettigs@" is
enabled, pressing #Ctrl-PgUp# works the same as pressing #Esc# -
cancels drive selection and closes the menu.

    Pressing #Shift-Enter# invokes the Windows Explorer showing the
root directory of the selected drives (works only for disk drives and
not for plugins).

@DisconnectDrive
$ #Disconnect network drive#
  You can disconnect a network drive by pressing #Del# in the ~Change Drive
menu~@DriveDlg@.

  The option #[x] Reconnect at logon# is enabled only for permanently
connected network drives.

  The confirmation can be disabled in the ~confirmations~@ConfirmDlg@ dialog.

@Highlight
$ #Files highlighting#
    For more convenient and obvious display of files and directories in
the panels, FAR Manager has the possibility of color highlighting for
file objects. You can group file objects by different criteria
(~file masks~@FileMasks@, file attributes) and assign colors to those groups.

    File highlighting can be enabled or disabled in the ~panel settings~@PanelSettings@
dialog (menu item Options | Panel settings).

    You can ~edit~@HighlightEdit@ the parameters of any highlight group
through the "~Options~@OptMenu@" menu (item "Files highlighting").

@HighlightList
$ #List of file highlighting groups#
    The ~file highlighting~@Highlight@ groups menu allows you to perform
various operations with the list of the groups. The following key
combinations are available:

  #Ins#          - Add a new highlighting group

  #F5#           - Duplicate the current group

  #Del#          - Delete the current group

  #Enter# or #F4#  - ~Edit~@HighlightEdit@ the current highlighting group

  #Ctrl-R#       - Restore the default file highlighting groups

  #Ctrl-Up#      - Move a group up.

  #Ctrl-Down#    - Move a group down.

    The highlighting groups are checked from top to bottom. If it is
detected that a file belongs to a group, no further groups are checked.

@HighlightEdit
$ #Files highlighting#
    The #Files highlighting# dialog in the ~Options menu~@OptMenu@ allows
to define file highlighting groups. Each group definition includes:

     - one or more ~file masks~@FileMasks@;

     - attributes to include;

     - attributes to exclude;

     - normal name, selected name, name under cursor and
       selected name under cursor colors to display file names.
       If you wish to use the default color, set color to "Black
       on black";

     - an optional character to mark files from the group.
       It may be used both with or instead of color highlighting.

    If the option "A file mask or several file masks" is turned off, file
masks will not be analyzed, and only file attributes will be taken into
account.

    A file belongs to a highlighting group if:

     - file mask analysis is enabled and the name of the file matches
       at least one file mask (if file mask analysis is disabled,
       the file name doesn't matter);

     - it has all of the included attributes;

     - it has none of the excluded attributes.

    The Compressed, Encrypted attributes and Symbolic links are valid for
NTFS drives only. The Encrypted attribute and Symbolic links can be used
only in Windows 2000/XP.

@ViewerSettings
$ #Viewer settings#
    This dialog allows to change the default internal or external viewer
settings.

    External viewer

                          Use ~special symbols~@MetaSymbols@ to specify the
                          name of the file to view. If you do
                          not wish to switch panels off before
                          executing the external viewer, start
                          command from '@@' character.

    Internal viewer

  #Save file position#      Save and restore positions in the recently
                          viewed files. This option also forces
                          restoring of character table, if the table
                          was manually selected by user, and the file

                          Ctrl-S in the internal viewer.

  #Show arrows#             Show scrolling arrows in viewer if the text
                          doesn't fit in the window horizontally.

    If the external viewer is assigned to F3 key, it will be executed
only if the ~associated~@FileAssoc@ viewer for the current file type is
not defined.

    Modifications of settings in this dialog do not affect previously
opened internal viewer windows.

    The settings dialog can also be invoked from the ~internal
viewer~@Viewer@ by pressing #Alt-Shift-F9#. The changes will come
into force immediately but will affect only the current session.

@EditorSettings
$ #Editor settings#
    This dialog allows to change the default external and internal editor
settings.

    External editor

  #Use for F4#              Run external editor using F4.

  #Use for Alt-F4#          Run external editor using Alt-F4.

  #read-only files#         is opened for editing, a warning message
                          will be shown.


    If the external editor is assigned to F4 key, it will be executed only
if ~associated~@FileAssoc@ editor for the current file type is not defined.

    Modifications of settings in this dialog do not affect previously
opened internal editor windows.

    The settings dialog can also be invoked from the ~internal
editor~@Editor@ by pressing #Alt-Shift-F9#. The changes will come
into force immediately but will affect only the current session.

@DistTable
$ #Auto detect character tables#
    If you use several character tables and have installed the
table with the character frequency distribution for your language (for
example, for Russian the table "Addons\Tables\Russian\Dist.Rus.reg"
should be installed), FAR will try to choose the most suitable
character table for viewing/editing a file. Note that correct
detection is not guaranteed, especially for small or non-typical text
files.

    You can find some character tables in the "Addons\Tables" folder
of the root FAR folder.

@FileAttrDlg
$ #File attributes dialog#
    With this command it is possible to change file attributes and
file time. Either single file or group of files may be processed.
If you do not want to process files in subfolders, clear
the "Process subfolders" option.

  #File attributes#

    Checkboxes used in the dialog can have the following 3 states:

     #[x]# - attribute is set for all selected items
           (set the attribute for all items)

     #[ ]# - attribute is not set for all selected items
           (clear the attribute for all items)

     #[?]# - attribute state is not the same for selected items
           (don't change the attribute)

    When all selected files have the same attribute value, the corresponding
checkbox will be in 2-state mode - set/clear only. When there are selected
folders, all checkboxes will always be 3-state.

    Only those attributes will be changed for which the state of the
corresponding checkboxes was changed from the initial state.

    The "Compressed" and "Encrypted" attributes may be changed only on NTFS
drives. The "Encrypted" attribute can be used in Windows 2000/XP only. These two
attributes are mutually exclusive, that is, you can set only one of them.

    For ~folder links~@HardSymLink@ the dialog will display the original folder information
(NTFS/Windows 2000/XP only).

  #File date and time#

    Three different file times are supported:

    - last modification time;

    - creation time;

    - last access time.

    On FAT drives the hours, minutes and seconds of the last access time
are always equal to zero.

    If you do not want to change the file time, leave the respective
field empty. You can push the #Blank# button to clear all the date and
time fields and then change an individual component of the date or
time, for example, only month or only minutes. All the other date and
time components will remain unchanged.

    The #Current# button fills the file time fields with the current time.

    The #Original# button fills the file time fields with their original
values. Available only when the dialog is invoked for a single file object.

    For ~symbolic links~@HardSymLink@ (supported only under NTFS/Windows
2000/XP) the date and time cannot be set.

@FolderShortcuts
$ #Folder shortcuts#
    Folder shortcuts are designed to provide fast access to frequently
used folders. Press Ctrl-Shift-<N>, where N is '0'..'9', to create a shortcut
to the current folder. To change to the folder recorded in the shortcut,
press RightCtrl-<N>. If RightCtrl-<N> pressed in edit line, it inserts
the shortcut path into the line.

    The #Show folder shortcuts# item in the ~Commands menu~@CmdMenu@ may be
used to view, set, edit and delete folder shortcuts.

@Filter
$ #File panel filter#
    Using the filter you may control which files will be displayed
in the file panel.

    The filter menu contains two parts. In the upper part custom filters are
shown. Use Ins, Del and F4 keys to add, delete and edit these filters. Each
custom filter consists of an optional title and a file mask or several
~file masks~@FileMasks@ delimited by commas.

    The lower part of the filter menu contains masks of all files from the
active file panel.

    Use Space, '+' and '-' keys to select filter menu items. Selected items
will be indicated by '+' marks. If filters are present, only files which are
filtered will be shown.  Items selected with '-' will be indicated by '-'
mark, and all files matching these items will be excluded from the file panel.

    Custom filters selection is stored in the FAR configuration.

    When a filter is used in a panel, it is indicated by '*' after
the sort mode letter in the upper left corner of the panel.

@FileDiz
$ #File descriptions#
    File descriptions may be used to associate text information with a file.
Descriptions of the files in the current folder are stored in this folder in
a description list file. The format of the description file is the file name
followed by spaces and the description.

    Descriptions may be viewed in the appropriate file panel
~view modes~@PanelViewModes@. By default these modes are #Descriptions#
and #Long descriptions#.

    The command #Describe# (Ctrl-Z) from the ~Files menu~@FilesMenu@ is
used to describe selected files.

    Description list names may be changed using #File descriptions#
dialog from the ~Options menu~@OptMenu@. In this dialog you can also
set local descriptions update mode. Updating may be disabled,
enabled only if panel current view mode displays descriptions or always
enabled. By default FAR sets "Hidden" attribute to created description
lists, but you may disable it by switching off the option
"Set "Hidden" attribute to new description lists" in this dialog.
Also here you may specify the position to align new file descriptions
in a description list.

    If a description file has the "read-only" attribute set, FAR does
not attempt to update descriptions, and after moving or deleting file
objects, an error message is shown. If the option
"#Update read only description file#" is enabled, FAR will attempt to
update the descriptions correctly.

    If it is enabled in the configuration, FAR updates file
descriptions when copying, moving and deleting files. But if a command
processes files from subfolders, descriptions in the subfolders are not
updated.

@PanelViewModes
$ #Customizing file panel view modes#
    The ~file panel~@FilePanel@ can represent information using 10 predefined
modes: brief, medium, full, wide, detailed, descriptions, long descriptions,
file owners, file links and alternative full. Usually it is enough,
but if you wish, you may either customize its parameters or even replace
them with completely new modes.

    The command #File panel modes# from the ~Options menu~@OptMenu@ allows to
change the view mode settings. First, it offers to select the desired mode
from the list. In this list "Brief mode" item corresponds to brief panel mode
(LeftCtrl-1), "Medium" corresponds to medium panel mode (LeftCtrl-2) and
so on. The last item, "Alternative full", corresponds to view mode called with
LeftCtrl-0. After selecting the mode, you may change the following settings:

  - #Column types# - column types are encoded as one or several
characters, delimited with commas. Allowed column types are:

    N[M,O,R]  - file name
                where: M - show selection marks
                       O - show names without paths
                           (intended mainly for plugins)
                       R - right aligned names
                These modifiers may be used in combination,
                for example NMR

    S[C,T]    - file size
                where: C - format file size with commas;
                       T - use 1000 instead of 1024 as divider,
                           if column width is too small to show
                           full size;
    P[C,T]    - packed file size
                where: C - format file size with commas;
                       T - use 1000 instead of 1024 as divider,
                           if column width is too small to show
                           full size;
    D         - file modification date
    T         - file modification time

    DM[B,M]   - file modification date and time
    DC[B,M]   - file creation date and time
    DA[B,M]   - file last access date and time
                where: B - brief (Unix style) file time format;
                       M - use text month names;

    A         - file attributes
    Z         - file descriptions
    O         - file owner
    LN        - hard links number

    If the column types description contains more than one file name
column, the file panel will be displayed in multicolumn form.

    File attributes have the following indications:

       #A#         - Archive
       #R#         - Read only
       #H#         - Hidden
       #S#         - System
       #C# or #E#    - Compressed or Encrypted
       #L#         - Symbolic links (reparse point)

  - #Column widths# - used to change width of panel columns.
If the width is equal to 0, the default value will be used. If the width of
the Name, Description or Owner column is 0, it will be calculated
automatically, dependant upon the panel width. For correct operation with
different screen widths, it is highly recommended to have at least one column
with automatically calculated width.

    Incrementing the default width of the file time column or file date and
time column by 1 will force a 12-hour time format. Further increase will
lead to the display of seconds and milliseconds.

    To display years in 4-digits format increase the date column width by 2.

  - #Status line column types# and #Status line column widths# -
similar to "Column types" and "Column widths", but for panel status line.

  - #Fullscreen view# - force fullscreen view instead of half-screen.

  - #Align file extensions# - show file extensions aligned.

  - #Show folders in uppercase# - display all folder names in upper
case, ignoring the original case.

  - #Show files in lowercase# - display all file names in lower case,
ignoring the original case.

  - #Show uppercase file names in lowercase# - display all uppercase
file names in lower case. By default this option is on, but if you wish
to always see the real files case, switch it, "Show folders in uppercase"
and "Show files in lowercase" options off. All these settings only change
the method of displaying files, when processing files FAR always uses the
real case.

  - #Use case sensitive sort# - use case sensitive sort for file names.

@SortGroups
$ #Sort groups#
    File sort groups may be used in #by name# and #by extension#
~file panel~@FilePanel@ sort modes. Sort groups are applied by
pressing #Shift-F11# and allow to define additional file sorting rules,
complementary to those already used.

    Each sort group contains one or more comma delimited
~file masks~@FileMasks@. If one sort group position in the group list
is higher than another and an ascending sort is performed, all files
belonging to this group files will be higher than those belonging to
following groups.

    The command #Edit sort groups# from the ~Commands menu~@CmdMenu@ is used
to delete, create and edit sort groups, using Del, Ins and F4. The groups
above the menu separator are applicable to the file panel start, and
included files will be placed higher than those not included to any group.
The groups below the menu separator are applicable to the file panel end,
and included files will be placed lower than those not included.

@FileMasks
$ #File masks#
    File masks are frequently used in FAR commands to select single files
and folders or groups of them. Masks may contain common valid file name
symbols, wildcards ('*' and '?') and special expressions:

    #*#           any number of characters;

    #?#           any single character;

    #[c,x-z]#     any character enclosed by the brackets.
                Both separate characters and character intervals
                are allowed.

    For example, files ftp.exe, fc.exe and f.ext may be selected
using mask f*.ex?, mask *co* will select both color.ini and edit.com,
mask [c-f,t]*.txt can select config.txt, demo.txt, faq.txt and tips.txt.

    In many FAR commands you may enter several file masks separated
with commas or semicolons. For example, to select all the documents,
you can enter #*.doc,*.txt,*.wri# in the "Select" command.

    You may enclose any mask (but not the entire list) in quotes.
For example, you have to do this when a mask contains any of the delimiter
characters (a comma or a semicolon), so that the mask doesn't get confused
with a list.

    In some commands (~Find files~@FindFile@, file ~selection~@SelectFiles@,
file ~associations~@FileAssoc@, ~sort groups~@SortGroups@ and
~file highlighting~@Highlight@) you may use exclude masks. An #exclude mask#
is one or multiple file masks that must not be matched by the files
matching the mask. The exclude mask is delimited from the main mask by
the character '#|#'.

^Usage examples of exclude masks:
 1. *.cpp
    All files with the extension #cpp#.
 2. *.*|*.bak,*.tmp
    All files except for the files with extensions #bak# and #tmp#.
 3. *.*|
    This mask has an error - the character | is entered, but the
    mask itself is not specified.
 4. *.*|*.bak|*.tmp
    Also an error - the character | may not be contained in the mask
    more than once.
 5. |*.bak
    The same as *|*.bak

    The comma (or semicolon) is used for separating file masks from each
other, and the '|' character separates include masks from exclude masks.


@SelectFiles
$ #Selecting files#
    To process several ~file panel~@FilePanel@ files and folders,
they may be selected using different methods. #Ins# selects the file under
the cursor and moves the cursor down, #Shift-Cursor keys# move the cursor
in different directions.

    #Gray +# and #Gray -# perform group select and deselect,
using one or more ~file masks~@FileMasks@ delimited by commas.
#Gray *# inverts the current selection. #Restore selection#
command (#Ctrl-M#) restores the previously selected group.

    #Ctrl-<Gray +># and #Ctrl-<Gray -># selects and deselects
all files with the same extension as the file under cursor.

    #Alt-<Gray +># and #Alt-<Gray -># selects and deselects
all files with the same name as the file under cursor.

    #Ctrl-<Gray *># inverts the current selection including folders.
If #Select folders# option in ~Panel settings~@PanelSettings@ dialog
is on, it has the same function as #Gray *#.

    #Shift-<Gray +># and #Shift-<Gray -># selects and deselects
all files.

    If no files are selected, only the file under the cursor will be
processed.

@CopyFiles
$ #Copying, moving, renaming and creating links#
    Following commands may be used to copy, move and rename
files and folders:

  Copy ~selected~@SelectFiles@ files                                           #F5#

  Copy the file under cursor regardless of selection      #Shift-F5#

  Rename or move selected files                                 #F6#

  Rename or move the file under the cursor                #Shift-F6#
  regardless of selection

  Create ~file links~@HardSymLink@                                         #Alt-F6#

    If the option "#Process multiple destinations#" is enabled, you
may specify multiple copy or move targets in the input line. In this
case, targets should be separated with a character "#;#" or "#,#". If
the name of a target contains the character ";" or ",", it must be
enclosed in quotes.

    If you wish to create the destination folder before copying,
terminate the name with backslash. Also in the Copy dialog you may press
#F10# to select a folder from the active file panel tree or #Alt-F10#
to select from the passive file panel tree. #Shift-F10# allows to open
the tree for the path entered in the input line (if several paths are
entered, only the first one is taken into account). If the option "Process
multiple filenames" is enabled, the dialog selected in the tree is appended
to the edit line.

    The possibility of copying, moving and renaming files for plugins
depends upon the plugin module functionality.

    If a destination file already exists, it can be overwritten,
skipped or appended with the file being copied.

    If during copying or moving the destination disk becomes full,
it is possible to either cancel the operation or replace the disk and
select the "Split" item. In the last case the file being copied will be
split between disks. This feature is available only when "Use system
copy routine" option in the ~System settings~@SystemSettings@ dialog
is switched off.

    Option "Copy access rights" is valid only for the NTFS file
system and allows the copying of file access information.

    Parameter "Only newer file(s)" will allow to copy (move) the new
and updated files without additional prompts. Updated files are those
files for which the modification date is later than the modification
date of the target file.

    Option "Use system copy routine" from ~System settings~@SystemSettings@
dialog forces the Windows function CopyFileEx usage (or CopyFile if CopyFileEx
is not available) instead of the internal copy implementation to copy files.
It may be useful on NTFS, because CopyFileEx performs a more rational
disk space allocation and copies file extended attributes.

    When moving files, to determine whether the operation should be
performed as a copy with subsequent deletion or as a direct move
(within one physical drive), FAR takes into account Windows 2000/XP
~symbolic links~@HardSymLink@.

    FAR handles copying to #con# in the same way as copying to #nul# -
that is, the file is read from the disk but not written anywhere.

@HardSymLink
$ #Hard and Symbolic link#
    On NTFS partitions you can create #hard links# and #symbolic links#
using the #Alt-F6# command.

    Hard links are created for files. Symbolic links are for directories
and drives.

    #Hard link#

    A #hard link# is an additional directory entry for the given file.
When a hard link is created, the file is not copied itself, but receives
one more name or location, while its previous name and location remain
intact. Since the moment of its creation, a hard link is
indistinguishable from the original entry. The only difference is that
short file names are not created for hard links, and so they cannot be
seen from DOS programs.

    When the file size or date changes, all of the corresponding directory
entries are updated automatically. When a file is deleted, it is not
deleted physically until all the hard links pointing at it will be
deleted. The deletion order doesn't matter. When a hard link is deleted
into the recycle bin, the number of links of a file does not change.

    FAR can create hard links and can show the number of the file's hard
links in a separate column (by default, it's the last column in the 9th
panel mode) and sort the files by hard link number.

    Hard links are supported in NTFS starting from Windows NT 4.0.
Hard links can only be created on the same drive as the source file.

    #Symbolic links#

    NTFS starting with version 5.0 (Windows 2000/XP) supports symbolic links
(SymLink). Symbolic links between directories in Windows 2000/XP are known as
"directory junctions". Directory junctions is a technology allowing to
map any local directories to any other local directories. For example,
if the directory D:\SYMLINK has C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 as its target, a program
accessing D:\SYMLINK\DRIVERS will actually access C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS.

    FAR supports creating symbolic links only on local drives that have
a file system supporting that capability (Windows 2000/XP/NTFS 5.0). Unlike
hard links, symbolic links are not required to have a target on the same
drive.

    It is not allowed to create symbolic links directly to CD-ROM
directories, but this restriction can be overcome by mounting a CD-ROM
to a directory on an NTFS partition.

@ErrCopyItSelf
$ #Error: copy/move onto itself.#
    You may not copy or move a file or folder onto itself.

    This error can also happen under Windows 2000/XP, if there are two
directories, one of which is a ~symbolic link~@HardSymLink@ to another.

@WarnCopyStream
$ #Warning: copying or moving file with multiple streams#

   The source file contains more than one data stream or the
destination file system does not support files with multiple streams.

   Streams are a feature of the NTFS file system allowing to associate
additional information with a file (for example, author's name, title,
keywords and so on, or any other data). This information is stored
together with the file and is invisible to programs that do not
support streams. For example, streams are used by Windows Explorer in
Windows 2000/XP to store additional file properties (summary).
FAT/FAT32 file systems do not support streams.

   To copy a file completely (together with all its streams), turn on
the option "#Use system copy routine#" in the
~system settings~@SystemSettings@ dialog.

   If you are copying a file with multiple streams to a volume with a
file system other than NTFS, you will also lose data - only the main
stream will be copied.

   If a directory has multiple streams, the additional streams will be
copied only when the directory is moved (F6).

@ScrSwitch
$ #Screens switching#
    FAR allows to open several instances of the internal viewer and editor
at the same time.  Use #Ctrl-Tab#, #Ctrl-Shift-Tab# or #F12# to switch between
panels and screens with these instances. Ctrl-Tab switches to the next screen,
Ctrl-Shift-Tab to the previous, F12 shows a list of all available screens.

    The number of background viewers and editors is displayed in the left
panel upper left corner. This may be disabled by using ~Panel settings~@PanelSettings@
dialog.

@ApplyCmd
$ #Apply command#
    With #Apply command# item in ~Files menu~@FilesMenu@ it is possible
to apply a command to each selected file. The same
~special symbols~@MetaSymbols@ as in ~File associations~@FileAssoc@
should be used to denote the file name.

    For example, 'type !.!' will output to the screen all selected files,
one at a time, and the command 'rar32 m !.!.rar !.!' will move all selected
files into RAR archives with the same names. The command 'explorer /select,!.!'
will start the Windows Explorer and set the cursor to the current file or
directory.

@OSCommands
$ #Operating system commands#
    FAR Manager by itself processes the following operating system commands:

    #CLS#

    Clears the screen.

    #disk:#

    To change the current disk on the active panel to the specified disk.

    #CD [disk:]path# or #CHDIR [disk:]path#

    To change the current path on the active panel to the specified path.
If the disk drive letter is specified, the current disk is also changed.
If the active panel shows a ~plugin~@Plugins@ emulated file system,
the command "CD" in the command line may be used to change the folder
in the plugin file system. Unlike "CD", "CHDIR" command always treats the
specified parameter as a real folder name, regardless of the file panel type.

    #SET variable=[string]#

    Set environment variable "variable" to the value "string". If "string"
is not specified, the environment variable "variable" will be removed.
On startup, FAR Manager sets several ~environment variables~@FAREnv@ by
itself.

    #IF [NOT] EXIST filename command#

    Execute a command "command" if "filename" exists. Prefix "NOT" - execute
the command only if the condition is false.

    #IF [NOT] DEFINED variable command#

    The "DEFINED" conditional works just like "EXISTS" except it takes an
environment variable name and returns true if the environment variable
is defined.


    "IF" commands can be nested, for instance, command "command"

    #if exist file1 if not exist file2 if defined variable command#

    will be executed if the file "file1" exists, the file "file2" does not
exist and the environment variable "variable" is defined.

    Notes:

    1. Any other commands will be sent to the operating
       system command processor.

    2. The commands listed above work in:
       - ~Command line~@CmdLineCmd@
       - ~Apply command~@ApplyCmd@
       - ~User menu~@UserMenu@
       - ~File associations~@FileAssoc@

@FAREnv
$ #Environment variables#
    On startup, FAR Manager sets the following environment variables
available to child processes:

    #FARUSER#            the name of the user given in the /u
                       ~command line~@CmdLine@ parameter.

    #FARLANG#            name of the current interface language.

@KeyMacro
$ #Keyboard macros#
    Keyboard macros may be used to redefine standard FAR keys,
key combinations or to implement new keyboard commands.

    To define a key macro press #Ctrl-<.># (Ctrl and dot key) followed by
desired keys sequence, then Ctrl-<.> again and the key or key combination
to which the macro should be assigned. FAR displays 'R' character
in the upper left screen corner while recording a macro command.

    To delete a macro and return the key its original function
press Ctrl-<.> twice and then the key to which the macro was assigned.

    In addition to standard FAR keys combinations it is possible to assign
macros to Ctrl-Shift-<letter>, Ctrl-Alt-<letter> and Alt-Shift-<letter>.

    FAR supports several independent macro sets: shell, viewer, editor and
few other macro types. Macro sets are saved when the command "Save setup"
from the ~Options menu~@OptMenu@ is executed.

    To specify ~additional macro settings~@KeyMacroSetting@, start or finish macro
recording with #Ctrl-Shift-<.># instead of Ctrl-<.> and select the desired
options in the dialog.

    #Assigning a macro command to the F1 key#

    When F1 is pressed for the first time, this help topic will be show.
Pressing F1 again after closing the help will assign the macro command
to the F1 key.

    #Assigning a macro command to the Enter key#

    To assign a macro command to the Enter key, you should press Enter
twice. When Enter is pressed the first time, the key will be assigned;
pressing it again will confirm the assignment and close the dialog.

@KeyMacroSetting
$ #Macro command settings#
    To specify additional ~macro command~@KeyMacro@ settings, start or
finish macro recording with #Ctrl-Shift-<.># instead of Ctrl-<.> and select
the desired options in the dialog:

  #Allow screen output while executing macro#

    If this option is not set during the macro command execution
    FAR Manager does not redraw the screen. All the updates will
    be displayed when the macro command playback is finished.

  #Execute after FAR start#

    Allows to execute the macro command immediately after the
    FAR Manager is started.

  Macro command execution conditions:

    #Command line is empty#
       [x] - execute only if the command line is empty
       [ ] - execute only if the command line is not empty
       [?] - ignore the command line state

    #Plugin panel#
       [x] - execute only if the current panel is a plugin panel
       [ ] - execute only if the current panel is a file panel
       [?] - ignore the panel type

    #Execute for folders#
       [x] - execute only if a folder is under the panel cursor
       [ ] - execute only if a file is under the panel cursor
       [?] - execute for both folders and files

    #Selection exists#
       [x] - execute only if there are marked files/directories
             on the panel or a selected block in the editor
       [ ] - execute only if there are no marked files/directories
             on the panel or no selected block in the editor
       [?] - ignore the block/file selection state
