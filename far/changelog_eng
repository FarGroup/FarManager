1. The "ACHTUNG"s have started at macros (see comments on 1454 and 1455).

   * $Date command is removed
       replace it with print(Date(blablabla_or_nothing))
   
   * $MMode command is removed
       replace it with mmode(1,2)
   
   * IClip state is removed
       replace it with clip(5,-1) (notice that clip() returns 1 or 2)
   
   * $IClip command is removed
       replace it with clip(5,0) or just clip(5)

   * DisableOutput state is removed (not the macro flag!)
       replace it with mmode(1,-1) function call

1. And once more, Mantis#1429: Incorrect work after launch as "... | far.exe /v -"
   apiCreateFile() adds flags (perhaps this has to be removed as it is not clear at all?),

1. A couple of bugs at attributes setup.

2. Experimental: file names are copied from panel into clipboard in additional CF_HDROP format,
   which allows "paste" the files from clipboard to other applications (Explorer etc.).
   Reverse operation (copy "there" and paste "here") is not supported so far, buf everything's possible.

t-rex 08.07.2010 00:34:21 +0200 - build 1608

   with no explicit notation whether it is a file or a directory.
   The necessary option is chosen automatically according to the attributes of 
   referred object.

2  FLINK_SYMLINK flag is available in FSF.MkLink, it enables automatic 
   selection of symbolic link type.

drkns 02.07.2010 16:17:18 +0200 - build 1603

1. Mantis#0001425: a bug at files highlighting settings reset

  KeyMacro::GetCurRecord() function returned wrong data (library code was taken instead of data from working macro)

2. Mantis#0001423: Check the state of menu item
  N=Menu.ItemStatus([N]);

  Return the state of N-th menu item (N is 1-based), or current item if N==0 or unspecified.

  0x00000040 - Hotkey is present
  0x00000080 - Hotkey is manually specified by user
      
drkns 01.07.2010 22:20:00 +0200 - build 1600

  support for custom column (C0), filled by plugins, in non-plugin file panels
int WINAPI GetCustomDataW(const wchar_t *FilePath, wchar_t **CustomData)
void WINAPI FreeCustomDataW(wchar_t *CustomData)

t-rex 11.06.2010 18:16:03 +0200 - build 1585

1. Same as 1584.1 but for plugin panel refresh.

drkns 11.06.2010 13:47:00 +0200 - build 1584

drkns 31.05.2010 22:40:13 +0200 - build 1577

3. When resizing FAR window in "/w" mode, console content is not erased.
  This is an experimental feature, tiny artifacts are possible etc.

drkns 25.05.2010 19:57:53 +0200 - build 1573

1. ACTL_GETFARRECT - "correct" way of obtaining the coordinates of FAR "window" in console buffer;
  ACTL_GETCURSORPOS - getting cursor coordinates regarding to FAR "window";

1. Specifications of previous build.

drkns 22.05.2010 20:00:00 +0200 - build 1564

1. Encapsulation of all used console functions.
  As a consequence, the following long awaited feature has become possible: Far can work in console window (not buffer) bounds.
  Set large buffer height and meditate over long console outputs. CtrlAlt scroll to corresponding direction.

   ACHTUNG! - this mode is guaranteed to break plugins which draw something in console directly or suppose naively that Far size is available via CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO::dwSize.

2. SetFileApisToANSI() is called after non-unicode plugins finish work.

t-rex 21.05.2010 18:25:32 +0200 - build 1563

1. Macro: S=Menu.GetValue([N]) function is added, which returns menu item text for given position (menu position is not changed).
  If N is not specified or equals to 0 then the action is similar to Menu.Value application
  For non-existing menu item, an empty string is returned.

zg 14.05.2010 02:18:32 +0200 - build 1552

1. after 1444, Param1 <> SendDlgMessage(DM_GETFOCUS) in DN_GOTFOCUS.

1. Help. From "Alexey Samlyukov"

2. "@ElevationDlg" is added. this is a stub so far, to prevent error messages

2. Forum: "Something strange has appeared at build 1539: a piece of frame remains in the corner after Ctrl-O".

drkns 05.05.2010 23:16:12 +0200 - build 1539

1. Specification of 1536: for example, when issuing "macro:post F7", indicator disappeared only after any key press.

drkns 04.05.2010 23:42:49 +0200 - build 1538

1. Privileges elevation didn't work in symlinks editing.

2. Assembler listing generation is off for VC build by default. It is controlled by ASM_LISTING make flag.

t-rex 04.05.2010 13:53:24 +0200 - build 1537

1. Somewhere in last builds, descriptions started to add '\0' before carriage return which caused different problems with 3rd party description-aware programs.

drkns 03.05.2010 12:45:16 +0200 - build 1536

1. Problems with Mantis#1362: that "macro execution indication" caused regular screen refreshes.

drkns 30.04.2010 01:01:01 +0200 - build 1530

1. The color of default button can be set up.

2. As a preparation to API breakup: DefaultButton field in dialog structures is now changed to DIF_DEFAULT, Focus is changed to DIF_FOCUS.
  This is related to internals only, plugins are not affected yet.

svs 29.04.2010 09:55:53 +0300 - build 1528

1. Macro: eval function is provided with capability of programmatical call of macro bound to a hotkey.
http://forum.farmanager.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=5257

  To do this, one must:
  a) set the second parameter of the function to 2
  b) set the first parameter to a string of "Area/Key" format
  Here:
  "Area" is the area which we want to call macro from;
  "/" is a delimiter;
  "Key" is the name of the key.
  "Area/" can be omitted, in this case "Key" is searched in current active macro area,
  and if "Key" is not found, then the search is continued in Common area.
  To switch off the search in Common area (limit it with "this" area only),
  one must pass the dot character as "Area".

  In mode 2 the function returns
  -1 - error
  -2 - no macro on hotkey (or the macro is blocked)
  0 - Ok

  Examples.
  eval("Shell/CtrlP",2) - call a macro assigned to CtrlP in Shell area
  eval("CtrlP",2) - call a macro assigned to CtrlP in current macro area or in Common area if CtrlP is not found in current macro area
 eval("./CtrlP",2) - call a macro assigned to CtrlP in current macro area only
 eval("Shell/Alt/",2) - call a macro assigned to Alt/ in Shell area
 eval("Alt/",2) - call a macro assigned to Alt/ in current macro area or Common if Alt/ is not found in current macro area
 eval("./Alt/",2) - call a macro assigned to Alt/in current macro area only

1. Mantis#1316: Erroneous copying of vertical blocks into clipboard.
  Another inner refactoring of work with clipboard, usual functions are appended with a class, places where sequential clipboard operations are applied need to be rewritten with this class to make things in one transaction.

drkns 22.04.2010 21:11:09 +0200 - build 1518

1. Specification of 1517.5: conversion error warning was displayed even when there was no need in it.

2. Privilege elevation requests are separated logically into "read requests" and "modification requests" and can be switched on/off separately.
  There's no interface so far, the registry only.

drkns 21.04.2010 14:47:00 +0200 - build 1517

1. Mantis#0001347: Remove dot in autocompletion.
  Items "." and ".." which are returned by FindFile sometimes are now thrown away at FindFile class level, not in a lot of different places.
  Code which uses FindFile must NOT assume these items presence and fight with them.

2. A portion of warnings from VS2010 static analyzer.

3. When creating folders like \1\2\3\4 the attempts were taken to create each item even if it had existed already.

4. File search doesn't restore last access time.

5. If text conversion errors took place while loading a file into the editor or while codepage switching, then an additional confirmation is requested on saving, + the messages are more verbose now.

  Now the editor's header set by plugin  (in status line, with ECTL_SETTITLE) isn't reset automatically
  after plugin stop its work (invoked with F11).
  Now plugins have to take care of editor's caption restoration by themselves (Info.EditorControl(ECTL_SETTITLE,NULL)).

drkns 19.04.2010 10:50:21 +0200 - build 1510

1. Next portion of apiCreateFile/ReadFile/WriteFile/etc. replacement with more intelligent classes. As a consequence, privileges elevation request seems to be fixed in several other operations.

2. When editing the user menu AltF4 wrote excessive byte order marks into temp file (one per each submenu instead one per file).

1. Mantis#0001344: Crash on help links follow
  size_t rules :-(
  This fix removes the crash only.
  To "fix the errors" in help the parser has to be edited (which goes beyond the limits of this fix)

t-rex 13.04.2010 00:04:24 +0200 - build 1501

1. StrLength(string) -> string.GetLength() in a couple of places.

drkns 12.04.2010 22:54:07 +0200 - build 1500

1. More informative messages on necessary privilege elevation.

svs 12.04.2010 17:53:57 +0300 - build 1499

1. The help froze on files with no empty line between sections   (for example, "Regular Expression Search and Replace, version 7.04")

drkns 12.04.2010 16:46:32 +0200 - build 1498

1. Miscellaneous trivia on privileges elevation.

2. CtrlEnd function in dialogs and command line is unified: round-robin items selection is borrowed from command line, selection of appended characters is taken from dialogs.

drkns 11.04.2010 02:23:13 +0200 - build 1494

1. Privileges elevation:
  - the query happens only if it's needed (the access is denied via ACL), not for every ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
  - file time and “compressed” and “sparse”attributes changing.
  - content search.
  - theoretically, own copy implementation must also work ("[ ] Use system copy routine"). It hasn't been tested thoroughly, be careful.

2. Some API functions (CreateFile/ReadFile/WriteFile/...) are grouped logically into a separate class (File), it is preferable to use it further.

3. CtrlEnd did not function in dialogs when autocompletion was off.

svs 09.04.2010 16:32:01 +0300 - build 1493

1. Macro: [A|P]Panel.Path0 - path on real FS (before calling of plugins, which create their own panel)
  The states are similar [A|P]Panel.Path, but they contain the path on real FS.
  If real FS is on the panel, then
[A|P]Panel.Path == [A|P]Panel.Path0
  If this is a plugin's panel, then
[A|P]Panel.Path != [A|P]Panel.Path0

N=5
V:
  -1 - what's being used? 1 - Windows clipboard, 2 - inner one
  0 - flip (analogous to $IClip)
  1 - switch to Windows clipboard
  2 - switch to inner clipboard

  Returns the previous value (1 - Windows clipboard, 2 - inner one)

3.

   Fix your macros:

   a) $IClip shall be replaced with Clip(5,0) or Clip(5), because $IClip will be removed.
   b) IClip shall be replaced with Clip(5,-1) (notice that clip() returns 1 or 2), because IClip will be removed.

  It is visible in current $Rep (current loop, for nested $Rep), for example

RCounter = undefined
$rep(%i)
...
  RCounter = value for loop "$rep(%i)"
...
$rep(%j)
...
RCounter = value for loop "$rep(%j)"
...
$end
...
RCounter = value for loop "$rep(%i)"
...
$end
RCounter = undefined

  Outside the loop, the constant value is undefined/any/meaningless.

2. Macro: "N=Print(Str)" function is added - display “str” at cursor.
  This is the $Text's analog, but Str can be an expression.
  It always returns 1.

3. Macro: "v = MMode(Action[,Value])" function is added - set/get modes for current macro.
  Analogous to $MMode, but mode  can be an expression.
  Action - what we want to change
  1 - screen lock mode ("DisableOutput")
  "MMode(1,-1)" is like "DisableOutput" state
  Value:
-1 - get (the function returns current value)
0 - off (the function switches Action off and returns previous value)
1 - on (the function switches Action on and returns previous value)
2 - flip (the function toggles Action and returns previous value)


4.

  Fix your macros:

 a) $Text has to be replaced with print() because $Text will be removed.
 b) $Date has to be replaced with print(Date(blablabla or empty)) because $Date will be removed.
 c) "$MMode 1" has to be replaced with "MMode(1,2)" because $MMode will be removed.
 d) "DisableOutput" state has to be replaced with "MMode(1,-1)" function call because "DisableOutput" state (not the macro flag!) will be removed.

  4 mentioned "objects" will be removed... say, in 2 months :-)

based on  http://forum.farmanager.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=5077
By now, it understands:
panelType - as usual: =0 - active panel, =1 - passive panel.
Action:
  0 - remove selection; return deselected elements count
  1 - select
  2 - invert selection
  3 - restore selection, analogous to Ctrl-M; return restored elements count
Mode:
  0 or absent - do Action for each element
  1 - Items is a number (index)
Items:
 for Mode==0 - ignored;
 for Mode==1:
  Items==0  or absent- do Action for current element
  Items>0 - do Action for the element with index Items
  The function returns elements count, on which Action is performed
  (info on current selected elements count is obtained via [A|P]Panel.SelCount as usual :-)

  The plans are to add Mode=2 and 3 (consider Items as strings - name or mask)

4. Macro: [A|P]Panel.HostFile is added - empty string or plugin panel host file name.

3. Macro: "$Continue" is added for loops.

4. A bug with shortcuts in editor/viewer:
  a) LCtrl- (where is unassigned shortcut) jumped to the very beginning of the file.
  b) Saving of shortcuts in registry was only possible if 0th element (RCtrl-0) was assigned .

  Here's the Achtung!
  Due to quite old bugs in registry, the content of shortcuts filled with zeros could be saved.
  Therefore, it is recommended to delete ShortXXX values in Editor\LastPositions and Viewer\LastPositions registry keys.
5. For uniformity... the word “Viewer” is removed from Opt.ViOpt.SaveViewerPos and Opt.ViOpt.SaveViewerShortPos.

1. The whole "." and ".." checking stuff is removed.
  It caused different problems to normal users, and all this for the sake of

1. Macro: Bug: [A|P]panel.Filter always returns 1, regardless of whether panel filter is on or off
2. Macro: problems with eval()

3. Macro: incorrect work of panel.setposidx()
  Now it works like this:
  Panel.SetPosIdx(0,0,0) - returns coordinates in file array taking the filter into consideration
  Panel.SetPosIdx(0,0,1) - returns coordinates in selected files virtual array taking the filter into consideration

4. “Config” variables related to macros are grouped into one structure.

5. Temporary rule is added: KeyMacros/CallPluginRules:dword (Mantis#1280)
  0 - block macros when invoking the plugin with calling the CallPlugin function, 1 - enable macros (achtung!)
   the default setting is 0 - block
   it is "temporary" to understand how necessary it is.

1. Mantis#0001286: Add mouse click state
  MsEventFlags constant is added, a bitset (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684239%28VS.85%29.aspx):
DOUBLE_CLICK = 0x0002
The second click (button press) of a double-click occurred.
The first click is returned as a regular button-press event.
MOUSE_HWHEELED = 0x0008
The horizontal mouse wheel was moved.
MOUSE_MOVED = 0x0001
A change in mouse position occurred.
MOUSE_WHEELED = 0x0004
The vertical mouse wheel was moved.

2. Macro: panel.setposidx()
  a) 3-rd optional parameter InSelection is added
N=Panel.SetPosIdx(panelType,Idx[,InSelection])
  if InSelection = 1, then Idx is an index in virtual array of selected visible files
  if InSelection = 0, then Idx is an index in virtual array of selected visible files
  b) now this fulction work only with selected files, considering applied panel filters.
  c) second parameter Idx:
  < 0 - "search" from the end to the beginning
  > 0 - "search" from the beginning to theend
  = 0 - ignore moving, just return the current position (considering the filter)

3. Macro: boolean states [A|P]Panel.Filter are added: "the filter is switched on at active/passive panel"

4. Macro: specification of 1401

5. Added: virtual public Panel::FileInFilter(long idxItem) and Panel::IsSelected(long idxItem)

I.e. nothing is substituted without user's control end everything is intuitively clear.
Hope this variant will suit everybody.

Sorry, no configuration interface so far. It will be done later.

P.S. As a bonus (and to match the system behaviour precisely) also primitive completion of file names is added at the same place. It works at the command line and dialog input lines with DIF_EDITPATH flag set.

a) addition to caption is a template;
b) addition is taken by Far from registry key Interface/TitleAddons:REG_SZ, " - Far%Ver%Admin" by default;
c) template characters understood by Far:
1. %Ver - Far Manager current version, for example, " 2.0" - Far adds a space before version string;
2. %Build - Far Manager current build, for example, " 1259" - Far adds a space before build string;
3. %Admin - in Vista and later it is replaced with LNG file value, " (Administrator)" by default - Far does NOT add a space.

Developing this topic, we can add... "%Debug" template for maniacs ;-)

2. SetFarTitle() function is moved from interf.?pp into ConsoleTitle class.

3. Macro: addition in #1 "IsUserAdmin" - 1 or 0 - the name of the user whom Far is started under.
Here's misunderstanding (speaking about myself :-)... now there's IsUserAdmin and "(Administrator)" isn't displayed (for OS older than Vista)
It's possible that IsUserAdmin for these OSes must be 0, even if the current user is administrator.

1. 1153.1 specification for the case of empty disk root directory.

drkns 29.09.2009 18:07:44 +0200 - build 1153

1. apiSetCurrentDirectory always returned TRUE, even if target directory didn't exist.
As a consequence, there was a possibility to enter nonexisting folders.
Also, Mantis#0001078: FCTL_SETPANELDIR succeeds for nonexisting path erroneously.

2. If titlebar is off in editor/viewer, there's no need to draw a clock.

3. As hex-view in UTF8 doesn't work anyway, prohibit this combination at all, to stop the flood of boring bugreports.

4. Some make-up: pass '*' into FindFirstFile, instead of '*.*'.

svs 29.09.2009 11:50:38 +0300 - build 1152

1. Mantis#0001064: Error in string handling
Next specification of operations:
1. string + string = string
2. string + num = string
3. num + string = string
4. strnum + string = string
5. string + strnum = string
6. num + strnum = num
7. strnum + num = num

i.e. (forcing conversion to string):
msgbox("1" + 0) ==> 1
msgbox(1 + "2") ==> 3
msgbox("foo1" + 0) ==> "foo10"
msgbox(string(1) + "2") ==> "12"
%i=1; msgbox("0" + string(%i)) ==> "01"
%i=1; msgbox(int("012ag") + %i) ==> 13
%i=1; msgbox(string(int("012ag")) + %i) ==> 13
%i=1; msgbox(string(int("012ag")) + string(%i)) ==> "121"

1. Edit::WordDiv was set to the value Editor::WordDiv::m_pData::m_pData.
If plugin changed editor's WordDiv to greater value, the memory
was reallocated, and Edit::WordDiv pointed to nothing.

2. In editor, when the clock was off and codepage was non-unicode, the parentheses in status string were cut.

3. gcc warnings.

drkns 28.09.2009 20:02:46 +0200 - build 1150

1. From Tim Sobolev: Mantis#0001074: It was impossible to create/edit/view file with name started with 2 or more '.'

svs 28.09.2009 20:59:21 +0300 - build 1149

1. Mantis#0001070: XLat: keyboard layout switching when more than 2 layouts are available
Added [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far2\XLat]"Layouts" - the string that contains enumeration of HKL of layouts to be "rolled", th delimiter is ';'
For ex., "Layouts"="04090409;04190419" (or "Layouts"="0409;0419")
If less than two are mentioned, then this behaviour is switched off, and layouts are switched like before.
Far reads first 10 values for "Layouts", others are ignored (I think this would be enough :-).

Also, the comment on rules is added (to stop looking for it :-)

2. Mantis#0001064: Error in string handling
Macro: Here, if there's "string1 operation string2", then the result is string (for '+' it is concatenation, for others it is "string1")

3. Macro: Five indices added for Editor.Set() (first parameter):
15: Show scrollbar
16: Allow editing files opened for writing
17: Select found (in search)
18: Regular expressions (in search)
19: Pick up the word (in search)

drkns 27.09.2009 22:50:36 +0200 - build 1148

1. Sometimes Far could crash if the console window was maximized at start.

2. FSF.ConvertNameToReal doesn't exist anymore. However, there is FSF.ConvertPath(CONVERTPATHMODES Mode,const wchar_t *Src, wchar_t *Dest, int DestSize)
In Mode=CPM_REAL it works like ConvertNameToReal;
In Mode=CPM_FULL it works like ConvertNameToFull.

Achtung: use of GetFullPathNameW for relative to absolute path conversion is wrong after build #1145, use ConvertPath(CPM_FULL, ...) instead.

3. gettable.?pp -> codepage.?pp

garry 27.09.2009 22:54:30 +0300 - build 1147

1. Mantis#0001017 A more common solution is done, i.e. codepage support is checked in both editor and viewer, and not only at autodetection, but also at codepage retrieval from cache;

2. A small refactoring connected with recode tables: function names and replacing Table -> CodePage;

3. From now, const UnicodeString& UnicodeString::SetData(const UnicodeString &strCopy) does not crash Far when provided with NULL;

4. TechInfo #80 (See build #1019).

drkns 27.09.2009 08:56:45 +0200 - build 1146

1. Take into account that if prefix \\?\ is used in paths then Windows' AI which replaces '/' to '\' is switched off, so you have to do it yourself.

2. At start, inner strCurrentDirectory is initialized with process' current directory, for those /e and /p to work.

drkns 27.09.2009 01:05:56 +0200 - build 1145

1. From Tim Sobolev: own implementation of ConvertNameToFull.
GetFullPathName problems must have been fixed now: special names (nul, con etc.), points/spaces at the end of the names etc.

2. From now, Far doesn't use SetCurrentDirectory in folder navigation.
The bonuses follow:
- walking on folders deeper than MAX_PATH;
- entering folders with trailing points, spaces and other nightmares;
- folder opened on panel is not blocked from outer deletion;
- et cetera.
Accordingly, bugs are expected to appear. Be careful.

For OEM plugins, though, the current directory is set before calling their exported functions, for compatibility.

For Unicode plugins nothing is set.
Thus, some careless plugins can malfunction somehow.
It's still not too late to repent and start using FCTL_GETCURRENTDIRECTORY.

(lots of formatting - spaces to tabs)

1. Macros are loaded after plugins (it is necessary for successive changes in macro engine)

2. keys.hpp: KEY_MACRO_U_BASE - place is reserved for Mantis#18 and Mantis#466

3. EnumRegValueEx() - added an argument: the type of enumerated value

4. Macro: Menu.Value - contains current menu item text as it is displayed on screen (w/o &)

5. Macro: added type double
Was __int64 and wchar_t*, now double is added. Actually, there's nothing to say more, but:
* fraction part divider is `.' (point);
* there's no functions like sin, cos, tan, etc. - this is for Mantis#0000466 and Mantis#0000018;
* the number occupies 8 bytes in memory;
* registry constants (branch "KeyMacro\Const") with REG_SZ type (according to (2) Far translates them to double on launch) this is lame (maybe it would be smart to store them as REG_BINARY);
* double-to-string translation follows the format "KeyMacro/CONVFMT:REG_SZ" (default is "%.6g")

6. Macro: the specification of "operations".
Starting from definitions::
* Int - an integer number;
* Dbl - a floatiog-point number;
* StrInt - string, which can be fully translated to Int;
* StrDbl - string, which can be fully translated to Dbl;
* Str - any other string, actually, the set of chars.
According to these definitions, string to number translation and calculation of result takes place where possible. Below are tables showing the results of those operations:
+         |B.Int    B.Dbl  B.StrInt  B.StrDbl   B.Str
----------+------+--------+---------+----------+------
A.Int     |Int      Dbl    Int       Dbl        Str
A.Dbl     |Dbl      Dbl    Dbl       Dbl        Str
A.StrInt  |Int      Dbl    Int       Dbl        Str
A.StrDbl  |Dbl      Dbl    Dbl       Dbl        Str
A.Str     |Str      Str    Str       Str        Str
Here Str means concatenation of two operands.

- * / %   |B.Int    B.Dbl  B.StrInt  B.StrDbl   B.Str
----------+------+--------+---------+----------+------
A.Int     |Int      Dbl    Int       Dbl        A.Str
A.Dbl     |Dbl      Dbl    Dbl       Dbl        A.Str
A.StrInt  |Int      Dbl    Int       Dbl        A.Str
A.StrDbl  |Dbl      Dbl    Dbl       Dbl        A.Str
A.Str     |A.Str    A.Str  A.Str     A.Str      A.Str
Here A.Str means that the value of operand A is returned.

For binary operations, Dbl or StrDbl operands are translated to Int beforehand.

Op        |B.Int    B.Dbl  B.StrInt  B.StrDbl   B.Str
----------+------+--------+---------+----------+------
A.Int     |Int      Int    Int       Int        A.Str
A.Dbl     |Int      Int    Int       Int        A.Str
A.StrInt  |Int      Int    Int       Int        A.Str
A.StrDbl  |Int      Int    Int       Int        A.Str
A.Str     |A.Str    A.Str  A.Str     A.Str      A.Str
Here "Op" is | & ^ << >>

In comparison operations (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=), the operands are translated (if possible) and compared.
In logical OR and AND the operands are compared as is, strings are not translated to StrInt and StrDbl, instead they are checked on non-emptiness.

7. Macro: Editor.SelValue - the content, like Far puts block into clipboard (text block with crlf at line ends)

8. Macro: function "Menu.Select" looks like "N=Menu.Select(S[,N[,Dir]])" - the 3rd parameter is added, the direction of search, Dir:

* 0 - from the beginning to the end of list;
* 1 - from the current position to the beginning;
* 2 - from the current position to the end of menu items list.

9. Help understands macros <!Macro:Vars!> and <!Macro:Consts!>, look for `"// for <!Macro:Vars">' in lng files - this is the output format

10. If Far is given keys /e or /v, the macros from the following regions are not loaded: Shell, Search, Disks, MainMenu, InfoPanel, QviewPanel, TreePanel, FindFolder

11. Mantis#0001057: Far Manager version 1.75 build 2605, x86 Crash when choosing Alt+F1/Alt+F2 -> Process List

2. Mantis#0001012: "In 1090, sometimes during copy/move there's a feeling that the name of new copied file appears when old file progressbar is still at 100%."

1. Whole copying visualization is moved to (almost) separate class.
  Progressbar redraw and wrong filename displaying bugs must have disappeared (Mantis#0001012).
  Also, a bunch of garbage is removed from copier.

2. As GetUserNameExW is used everywhere, let's reduce the code by linking it statically.

3. Quick preview panel had been reread and redrawn on every cough.

4. For file symlinks, "" is shown in panels at Size column.

5. MkSymLink() moved to flink.cpp.

1. Info panel missed a space after FS type.

2. "Memory" label overlayed panel border.

3. Mantis#0000859: RFE: Show UserName@Domain on the information panel
  Let's use the 8-th type, "UserName@Domain" (for local user, or there are errors when receiving a user... it will be like now: "user")
  + some formatting in InfoList::DisplayObject()

  in the largest accounts, visualization form has to be assigned (dialog? techinfo?).
