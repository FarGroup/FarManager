RULES
~~~~~

Submitting patches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, please, read all the sections below to get familiar with our build
system and rules.
When you feel comfortable with the code and decide to make your contribution
to the project, please follow those guidelines:
1. One logical change per patch, the smaller the patch the easier it is for us
   to review and commit it.
2. Try to keep inline with the overall style of the code.
3. Provide detailed changelog for your patch.
4. If your patch requires updating the documentation (help, Enc., etc.),
   please provide the needed updates.
5. Patches should be submitted as a collection of diff files, the best and
   easiest way to create a patch is:
   svn diff > file.diff
   Please create the patch against the latest code from the repository.
6. To submit a patch you should send it to one of the people mentioned in the
   MAINTAINERS file, please use their preferred method of contact - either way
   patches should be submitted through Mantis or E-Mail only. You should
   receive a response about your submission in not more than 10 days.
7. If you plan on creating large patches or want to keep current with the
   development of Far Manager, subscribe to the Developers mailing list
   http://groups.google.com/group/fardeven (fardeven@googlegroups.com).
8. Frequent patchers will be eligible for full SVN access, by our discretion.
9. Be patient, we are new to Open Source :)


Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~
1. There is a set of batch files to compile using VC:

   Do not edit those batch file directly!!!!!!!!!
   Only for permanent changes concerning all project members.
   Read the explanation below - everything is taken into account.

   --------------------
   vc.build.release.bat
   --------------------
   This batch file builds a release version of Far using VC and Far.mak.
   It also updates the far.release.dep file and the language files.
   By using this batch file you should never encounter any problems when
   building Far (except bugs in the code :).
   For this batch file to be universal so anyone can use it without changes it
   calls another batch file - custom.vc.release.bat - if such exists.
   That (custom.vc.release.bat) batch file you will have to create by yourself
   as it is your personal batch file and will not be committed to the SVN. In
   it you can define compile time variables and redefine the ones defined in
   the main batch file.
   For example my custom.vc.release.bat contains:
   ---->8----
   @echo off
   set NMAKE_OPTS=USE_VC8_32=1
   call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin\SetEnv.Cmd" /Release /x86 /xp
   ----8<----

   ------------------
   vc.build.debug.bat
   ------------------
   The same as vc.build.release.bat only build a debug version of Far, updates
   far.debug.dep and calls custom.vc.debug.bat if such exists.
   Example of custom.vc.debug.bat:
   ---->8----
   @echo off
   set NMAKE_OPTS=USE_VC8_32=1
   call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin\SetEnv.Cmd" /Debug /x86 /xp
   set FARSYSLOG=-DSYSLOG_TREX %FARSYSLOG%
   ----8<----

   The same goes for the x64 build only:
   vc.build.debug.64.bat --> custom.vc.debug.64.bat
   vc.build.release.64.bat --> custom.vc.release.64.bat

   If you want to use ulink as the linker then the following lines should be
   added to custom.vc...bat:
   ---->8----
   set NMAKE_OPTS=LINK_ULINK=1
   ----8<----
   or (for x86 versions compiled with VC8)
   ---->8----
   set NMAKE_OPTS=USE_VC8_32=1 LINK_ULINK=1
   ----8<----

   For build with VC9(VS2008), in custom.vc...bat must be included:
   ---->8----
   set NMAKE_OPTS=USE_VC9
   ----8<----

   By setting NMAKE_OPTS you can pass command line arguments to nmake


2. To compile with GCC there is a makefile_gcc that does everything.
   For the first run if the copyright.inc, farversion.inc and lang.hpp files
   do not exits, run the following:
   tools\m4 -P copyright.inc.m4 | tools\gawk -f ./scripts/enc.awk > copyright.inc
   tools\m4 -P farversion.inc.m4 > farversion.inc
   tools\lng.generator.exe -nc -i lang.ini farlang.templ


Changelog - "changelog" file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. All comments on committed changes should be written to the "changelog" file.
   You should leave comments in the source code only if you think the code is
   not self explanatory and won't be understood by "future generations".
2. Recent changes go on top.
3. Each entry starts with a header of the form:
   warp 05.12.2006 01:39:38 +0300 - build 2149
4. Changes not always require a build increase (i.e. cosmetic or non code
   related changes).


farversion.m4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. This file contains information used to generate Far version:
   a. BUILDTYPE, a string that defines the build type, can be:
      - `'      - empty string - release version
      - `alpha' - alpha version
      - `beta'  - beta version
      - `RC'    - release candidate
      - `AnyThingElse' - intended for Far versions which code has not been
        committed yet to the SVN so we and the users will not be confused.
        Far version will look something like that:
        FarVersion alpha AnyThingElse based on build BuildNumber
   b. BUILDTESTONLY, a flag to add TEST ONLY! to the version. Can be 1 or 0.
   c. BUILDTYPENUM, build type number - will be shown for alpha,beta,RC
      versions.
   d. MAJOR - MAJOR Far version (i.e. 1).
   e. MINOR - MINOR Far version (i.e. 71).


vbuild.m4
~~~~~~~~~
1. If the build number in "vbuild.m4"  was changed then after committing the
   changes to the SVN you should call "svn_tag_build.bat".


Exceptions (SEH)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Instead of _try, __try, etc. we use a macro - TRY
2. Instead of __except, etc. we use a macro - EXCEPT


GCC - ensuring "successful" compilation with GCC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Instead of postfixes i64 and ui64 use the macros _i64() and _ui64().


x64 - ensuring "successful" compilation for x86 and x64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. DWORD_PTR, LONG_PTR, etc. are used instead of DWORD/long/etc. in the
   following cases:

   a) needed where previously int/long/dword/or_any_other_non_pointer_type
      were used and a pointer value was assigned to it.
   b) ...
   c) ...


REMINDER
~~~~~~~~
Reminders, todos, notes should be written to the "REMINDER" file.
